Currently, the return type of `default` option is annotated with `object` since it is used for generating fresh object for each component instance. But there is another use case for `default` option of function in [portal-vue](https://github.com/LinusBorg/portal-vue) which is for dynamically generating unique value as default.
https://github.com/LinusBorg/portal-vue/blob/develop/src/components/portal.js#L16

The current typing breaks `this` type inference when the `default` function returns non-object type. I just relaxed the return type to `any` to avoid breaking the inference.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8537,"['types/options.d.ts', 'types/test/options-test.ts']",2018-09-18 02:33:58,,Maybe `() => T | null | undefined` is better instead of `() => any`?,

sodatea,8037,,fix(ssr): fix double escaping of staticClass values (fix #7859),closed,2018-04-16,"<!--
Please make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:
https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines
-->

This fixes a double escaping of literal class values in the SSR optimizing compiler by unescaping the value in `genClassSegments`.

This bugfix is very similar to https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7224. Literal class values get escaped twice during [`transformNode`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/79c0d7bcfbcd1ac492e7ceb77f5024d09efdc6b3/src/platforms/web/compiler/modules/class.js#L25) and [`flattenSegments`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/79c0d7bcfbcd1ac492e7ceb77f5024d09efdc6b3/src/server/optimizing-compiler/codegen.js#L240), causing the double escape.

fix #7859

This PR adds the `""sideEffects"": false` property in vue's `package.json` file. This allow's webpack (for those who want to opt-in to requiring vue's original source files (instead of the flattened esm bundles) and want to remove flow type through a babel-transform, then this will allow webpack to aggressively ignore and treeshake unused exports throughout the module system. 

In many cases this can yield hidden and surprising build time improvements and size reductions in the case that modules flattened from rollup aren't actually needed when webpack performs a scope analysis. 

The angular team has adopted this approach for the CLI yielding some strong build time speed for webpack (since unused exports are also not resolved, parsed, etc.). From my assessment of the module graph created, it looks that there are no sideEffects created against existing re-exports throughout the codebase, therefore even if a user did opt in on their own will, and remove flow types, there should be no danger of removing code that is needed and causing breakages. 

Overall, this already will not be a breaking change in any way but just provides extra benefits to those (and for the cli (if realized) when using webpack 4 and `mode: production`).

Happy to answer any other questions.

Could you please specify what you mean by ""vue's original source files""?

I looked at the index.js file in the src/core folder and to my knowledge there are plenty sideeffects that would be prune away by tree shaking. (e.g Object.defineProperty)

I hope you can help me understand how this works.

This fixes a crash during SSR, where a parent functional component is using an async component in the render function. If the prop is not copied, `renderAsyncComponent` crashes during rendering.

**Other information:**

After #7302, there's an asymmetry in `defineReactive` for properties that have both a getter and a setter.  On initial creation, the value returned by the getter is not made reactive since #7302 makes sure not to fetch it and `observe(val)` is a no-op.  However, if the value is set again after the property has been made reactive, it is made reactive as well since `observe(newVal)` in `set` is not gated on missing a getter.  (The premise justifying the change in #7280 that ""why should we get the value of the property in walk, despite the fact, that it is used only if the property has no getter"" is wrong, as the value was used in the call to `observe` even if the property had a getter.)

With the present change, properties that _only_ have a getter will still not have their value fetched and won't be made reactive, which should continue to satisfy @DeyLak's needs IIUC.  However, properties that have both a getter and a setter will continue to behave like they did before, being made recursively reactive, and their initial value treated consistently with subsequently set ones.

If you think that treating getter vs getter/setter properties differently is confusing, then you may want to revert #7302 instead so all values are made recursively reactive, irrespective of how the property is defined.  This may be easier for developers to understand but would break @DeyLak's use case.

Users using Vue from e.g. the CDN might be using the global `.Vue` without importing the module.

See https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html for details on the syntax",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7868,['types/index.d.ts'],2018-03-22 13:58:04,,"@yyx990803 This PR is missing in the 2.5.17 release. Is that intended?yes, the latest release only included a security fix@posva Thanks the info. I thought that 2.5.17 included all changes v2.5.17-beta.0 and was a normal release.

@RyanCavanaugh I installed this type definition using `npm install github:vuejs/vue`. However, the following script is marked as an error by the TypeScript compiler:
```ts
const vm = new Vue({
	el: ""#test"",
	data: ""test""
});
// ERROR [ts] Cannot use 'new' with an expression whose type lacks a call or construct signature.
```
Since the type definition of Vue is specified in `package.json`, I have set the value of the `moduleResolution` compiler option to `node` for the compiler to resolve it. The full content of `tsconfig.json` is as follows:
```json
{
	""compilerOptions"": {
		""target"": ""es2018"",
		""strict"": true,
		""noImplicitReturns"": true,
		""moduleResolution"": ""node"",
		""outDir"": ""dist""
	}
}
```
There is also an `index.d.ts` file in the project to reference the UMD globally:
```ts
/// <reference types=""vue""/>
```
Is there anything missing in my scripts?",

Through the processing of the `mergeOptions` function, the type of `vm.$options.data` is either a `function` or `undefined`.

Without modifiers compiler return original vm function, so we can expect to handle returned value (as example - handle it in directive)
```
on: {

With modifier it always return ""undefined"" because of missing return value

The handler code is `alert('x'); alert('y')`, so it will be compiled to `return alert('x'); alert('y')` and the second alert won't be shown, am I right?
Agree with @jacekkarczmarczyk. 
@posva , @Kingwl : Now return added only for single handler expressions. And result all the same with and without modifiers
``` @click=""test"" ``` =>```click:  _vm.test ``` 
``` @click=""test($event)"" ``` => ```click: function($event) { return  _vm.test($event) } ``` 
``` @click=""test($event)**;**"" ``` => ```click: function($event) { return  _vm.test($event) } ``` 
``` @click=""test1($event);test2($event)"" ```  => 
```
click: function($event) {  
    _vm.test1($event)
    _vm.test2($event)
}
 ``` 


And the same behavior with modifiersWhat about `@click=""alert(';')""`?
`split(';')` doesnt' seem to be the good solutionMaybe we should return only when the provided expression is a function: `<div @click=""doSomething"">` but not when it is a statement or expression: `<div @click=""doSomething()"">` It always possible to wrap things when you need to pass parameters:

```vue
<button @click="" e => doSomething('a parameter', e)"">Click me</button>
```@posva you're totally right. But there is a problem when we use modifiers. They wraps handler and we can't get result.

For now i'm stuck at parsing handler to check is multiple expressions inside of it
` /\)(?:\s*);(?:\s*)(?!.*'|"")/ `
http://take.ms/TcERo
If it contains single expression - add return; If not - leave handler as is.
A will be appreciate if someone help to check it correctly.
@jacekkarczmarczyk, @posva, @Kingwl maybe you could help? :)thanks for your pr 
please add more tests for the case  

> For now i'm stuck at parsing handler to check is multiple expressions inside of it
/\)(?:\s*);(?:\s*)(?!.*'|"")/

IMO parse expression with regex or other string operation is not a good chooice  
we need to reconsider this feature
ping @yyx990803 > But there is a problem when we use modifiers. They wraps handler and we can't get result.

I didn't dig deep into the code so I'm not sure what exactly you mean by it, but maybe there's an easy way to implement something like `handler.rawValue` to get access to non-wrapped handler?> implement something like handler.rawValue to get access to non-wrapped handler?  

we have not instanced the `rawValue` yet, the modifiers generated code has mixin with `handler`.  
instanced the `handler.rawValue` will lead to runtime code size increases 

Maybe we can implement it in a limited way as @posva said 


@posva, @jacekkarczmarczyk, @Kingwl,  Morning. I've re-implemented exactly as @posva proposed before. 

Now we expected that 
`@click=""test""` => `click: _vm.test`
`@click.prevent=""test""` => 
```
click: function($event) {
    $event.preventDefault()
    return _vm.test($event)
}
```

`@click.prevent=""test1();test2()""` => 
```
click: function($event) {
    $event.preventDefault()
    _vm.test1()
    _vm.test2()
}
```@posva checked this case:
`@click.prevent=""(e) => test1(e)""` compiled to:
```
click: function($event) {
                $event.preventDefault()
                ;(function(e) {
                  return _vm.test1(e)
                })($event)
              }
```@posva pushed change. Now ^ example returns 
```
click: function($event) {
                $event.preventDefault()
                return (function(e) {
                  return _vm.test1(e)
                })($event)
              }
```add some other test case for method path and function expression please@Kingwl there are 7 function expression tests was there. I've added more cases with methods and so on.",maybe `handlerCode`  should be wrap in a IIFE`split(';')` is not a good chooiceYou probably need to return here as well and adapt other test cases

Background: 
https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/676
https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/627#issuecomment-357124941

TypeScript cannot give reasonable completion for `Vue.extend`. For example, `methods`, `data` will not appear in completion list.  This is caused by the intricate overloading resolution in compiler host. https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8005.

This problem will probably not fixed in foreseeable future. So we can work around this by placing normal component option before functional component. In most case, normal component option provides better completion. However, this will break type inference for functional component definition. 

By providing an additional argument in normal component's `render`, we can at least compile functional component. Unfortunately, this work around will skip checking `RenderContenxt`. IMHO Vue's type checking isn't primarily for checking but for completion and definition looking up. So I think this is a advantageous trade-off. ",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7687,"['types/options.d.ts', 'types/vue.d.ts']",2018-03-08 18:55:53,,"Hmm, this reorder is not cost free. It will break functional component's type inference: `context` is inferred as `RenderContext<any>`. `Vue.extend` is used in Vetur and is recommended to TS users. So the benefit seems to exceed the cost.  While `new` and `component` isn't used directly in editor service, so completion doesn't have the same priority I think.Oh, I didn't notice the functional component's inference will be broken. Hmm, I'm not sure we should merge this change, then... After this change, the prop types of functional component will not be checked, will they? I don't know how many users rely on it but I personally rely on `Props` inference of `RenderContext` well.> After this change, the prop types of functional component will not be checked, will they?

No, they will not. 

I can change it to be checked. However, normal component's render function will still have non-existing context argument in types.IMHO, allowing non-existing context in normal component is acceptable since the users probably not want to check it by type checker. But props should be checked since users probably change props' name/type during maintenance and want to use type checker to help the refactoring.
So I think it's ok if at least prop types are checked.@ktsn do you think this is ready to merge?",

hirokiosame,7460,,fix(inject): hasOwn instead of 'in' (fix #7284),closed,2018-01-16,"The issue was caused by the [`in` operator check](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/instance/inject.js#L55) to see if an injection exists in a parent provide.

In the particular Issue, the injection didn't work because the the Symbol polyfill adds a setter to the Object prototype for every Symbol created and the `in`-operator check evaluated to true on any object inheriting Object. [Demo](http://jsfiddle.net/hirokiosame/dronjdzm/23/)

However, I'm thinking the implications of using `in` may be further reaching as it could have been any native prototype property. [Here](http://jsfiddle.net/hirokiosame/dronjdzm/24/) I demonstrate using the string `'constructor'` leads to unexpected injection behavior.

Although this fixes #7284, I am framing this as a fix for prototype properties being injected.

```js
export const bind = Function.prototype.bind ? nativeBind : bind
```> Maybe it's better to decide at first module run which implementation to use? e.g.:

```JavaScript
const ownBind = (fn: Function, ctx: Object) => {
  function boundFn(a) {
    const l = arguments.length
    return l
      ? l > 1
        ? fn.apply(ctx, arguments)

}

export const bind = Function.prototype.bind ? Function.prototype.bind : ownBind
```> Some browsers in the support range e.g. PhantomJS don't have Function.prototype.bind, so we should only use the native version when it exists.

Why we should carry polyfill for this? Phantomjs is a `virtual` browser that can be used for `tests` and scrapping. We carry polyfill for case when any vuejs site can be scrapped?

We increase bundle size for every build for ^ case?

I just didn't understood.I think
> ```js
> ...
> export const bind = Function.prototype.bind ? Function.prototype.bind : ownBind
> ```

Should be:
```js
function ownBind(fn: function, ctx: object) {
  // internal/current implementation ...
}

function nativeBind(fn: function, ctx: object) {
  return fn.bind(ctx)
}

export const bind = Function.prototype.bind ? nativeBind : ownBind
```

Because of how native `bind` should be called.So maybe wrap polyfill version in `if (process.NODE_ENV == 'development')` ? its removes dead code  in production builds and broke dead some e2e tests and scrappers.

I don't see its as as breaking change.**It is a breaking change if you remove a polyfill.**

Someone's tests that were able to run in PhantomJS would break suddenly in a patch release because of that.> It is a breaking change if you remove a polyfill.

Then its ready for merge.I think @OEvgeny 's suggestion should be applied so that we only check native bind once on initialization.I think this broke something. if fn.bind is undefined it blows up.@rlightner please provide a reproduction. `fn.bind` is only used when `Function.prototype.bind` exists. `fn.bind` cannot be undefined in that case unless `fn` is not a function.EDIT: I think this issue exposed a coding error. This should be a computed and not a method. It worked somehow before this fix though.

I'll try. The fn being passed in is a method in a template that contains:

```
drawer: {
    get() {
        return this.$store.state.drawer
    }
    , set(value) {
        this.$store.commit('toggleDrawer', value)
    }
}
```
and it's being passed in to `nativeBind` as the get/set. That doesn't have a bind(). This is in a normal vue template.

As @rlightner pointed out, this exposed a coding error if whatever's provided to the `bind` helper is not a function.

","It's missing the optional arguments, cause different behavior to ownBindI see no optional arguments in `ownBind`. Are you about `fn._length`? If yes.

Yes I'm aware of this. It may become this question: are we gonna emit a warning message for something might cause error but in we cannot be sure about that during the compiling stage? When the user handles the data correctly, it will work as expected. Or in this case, at least we should warn that `v-model` and `:value` will conflict for *some* input `type`s so users should be careful about the actual `type` they provide.> are we gonna emit a warning ... during the compiling stage?

In this case it might be too noisy for legitimate use. Warning after this pull request is good enough IMHO. However, a patch is still needed to handle code generation, like suppress `:value` emission when both type is dynamic and v-model is set. 

If warning is really desirable, generating a runtime warning in `type=""text""` branch is more pleasant in terms of DX. But it should be fine without it.",

**Other information:**

Fix bugs spotted in https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils/pull/317#discussion_r159149553.

Some type theory shenanigans below:

This pull request allows assigning `ComponentOption` of a Vue subclass to `Component`. The problem is that we used to mark default vm type  as `Vue` in `Component`. However, since `ComponentOption` is contravariant against vm type `V`. The default bound should not be the upper bound `Vue`, but the lower bound `never`.

For a more concrete example, consider this usage:

```ts
interface MyComponent extends Vue {
   num: number;
 }
 
const option: ComponentOptions<MyComponent> = {
  // a lifetime method
  created(this: MyComponent) { return this.num.toFixed() }
}
```

Then, assigning option to `ComponentOption<Vue>`, we could in theory do unsafe operation:

```ts
const anotherOption: ComponentOptions<Vue> = option

anotherOption.created.call(new Vue) // error! no property num on Vue!
```

Though it is not how we really use Vue, type checker cannot know this. To workaround, we can mark  `anotherOption` to have vm type as `never`.  `never` is the bottom type of any type, so `ComponentOption<never>`'s `create` method can accept nothing, and thusly any `create` method from subclass can satisfy _accepting nothing_ semantic. In practical words, this means we promise that we **never** use `created` like the way above.

### Remove legacy framework APIs

Remove the `init`, `reset`, `getRoot` and `receiveTasks` APIs, which are already implemented in the new version of `weex-js-runtime`.

Moreover, the deprecated timer APIs should also be removed when they were supported by native render engines (C++ timers).

### No longer execute the js code at front-end

Use `createInstanceContext` instead of `createInstance` to create the Vue module instance for each page. The Vue framework only needs to prepare the instance context and no longer execute the js code. The js code will be executed by native render engines.

### Flow type declarations

Add more reliable flow type declarations of Weex instance APIs and DOM APIs, and add type annotations for the entry file.

When using object for validating props, there are no checks about object content. This may take a long time before noticing that you forget to pass required prop, but there are no warnings with a misprint.

Fail cases:
- Typo in key name `deafult: false` or `require: true`
- Using non-english letter in key name (for example, russian)

P.S.: Will be great to add instance sections names validation, but I have no idea how to solve this (once I spent a lot of time before see that writed `component: {}` section instead `components: {}`).",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7198,"['src/core/util/options.js', 'src/core/util/props.js', 'test/unit/features/options/props.spec.js']",2017-12-14 16:39:32,,"Thanks for the PR. Placing the check in `assertProp` incurs more runtime cost than necessary (even only in dev mode) as `assertProp` is also called on every re-render of the component. This check only needs to be done once in `initProps`.@yyx990803 Thanks for info ‚Äî moved to `initProps`!Thanks for the update - as I was reviewing again I realized the runtime cost can be further reduced by placing the check [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/util/options.js#L297) when the options are normalized... (performed once per constructor)

Also, even though this is dev-only code, I'd prefer to refactor to use a `for...in` loop to get rid of the iteration functions.@yyx990803 doneThis warns about anything which relies on adding custom attributes to the prop object. For instance this: https://github.com/KoRiGaN/Vue2Leaflet/issues/109.

In another use-case, we add a `note` attribute to props for generating documentation.

I would suggest making this warning configurable somehow.A custom key `meta` like `vue-router` would be enough.",
felixbuenemann,7224,,fix(compiler): fix double escaping of ssrNode attribute values (fix #7223),closed,2017-12-12,"This fixes a double escaping of attribute values in the SSR optimizing
compiler, because literal attribute values get escaped early during the
call to `addAttr` inside `processAttrs` before it is known, if this
attribute will be serialized to an _ssrNode string template.

Later on the _ssrNode string template gets escaped again to preserve
whitespace and this causes double escaping of the whitespace inside the
attribute value.

This approach fixes the problem by undoing the escaping by parsing the
attribute value JSON in `genAttrSegment`, which is the easiest fix to
the problem, but probably not the best.

This fixes #7223 at least for the cases where I encountered the problem.

See #7223 for an in-depth description of the problem and a test-case.

`Component` is too restrictive about `props` type: it either accepts an array or an object, but not both. This makes it illegal to assign `CompoenntOptions` to `Component`. Actually it is a typing bug, but it requires TS 2.6 to find this out. 

So this pull request also bumps the compiler version. It only affects development.
Bumping version also finds another method naming problem in directive test :)

I am using this helper method to seal my objects before passing them to Vue:

      Vue.util.defineReactive(obj, key, obj[key]);

> This turns silent errors into nice verbose errors

Can you give an example? I don't think it makes sense to change Vue internals to cater to a specific userland use case.A simple example is a `v-model=""field.typoHere""`, with `typoHere` not existing. If the object is sealed, then writing to `typoHere` will trigger an error. If the object is not sealed, then this will silently succeed, but it will not have the intended behavior == bug. I prefer an error in this situation, because it can be tracked.

The current code has the assumption ""a sealed object can never be reactive"". Imho this is an assumption that does not hold universally. I don't see that as a specific use case. It is rather an unnecessary constraint that Vue currently has.The extensible check was added to avoid unnecessary perf cost of traversing objects that are known to be frozen. Are you trying to create objects that are frozen only on itself, but allowing deep mutations inside? I feel that really complicates things.

FYI in 2.5+ `v-model=""foo.bar""` creates `bar` as a reactive property if not already present so it no longer fails silently.> FYI in 2.5+ v-model=""foo.bar"" creates bar as a reactive property if not already present so it no longer fails silently.

It still fails silently if the property name is wrong. It sets the new property and makes it reactive, but this is not the property the developer intended to set.

> Are you trying to create objects that are frozen only on itself, but allowing deep mutations inside?

No. I am not freezing the objects, I only seal them, so new properties **can not** be added but existing ones **can** be modified.

What about using `Object.isFrozen` instead of `Object.isExtensible`? I think `isFrozen` is what you want for performance reasons.I have changed the PR accordingly. Please take another look. Is this better?`Object.isFrozen` returns `true` on a sealed object as well, I don't think that would fix your use case.You probably tested it on an empty object, which I also did initially. A sealed empty object is effectively frozen, since there is no property that could change. On non-empty objects it works as expected:
```
o1 = {};
Object.seal(o1);
console.log(Object.isSealed(o1), !Object.isExtensible(o1), Object.isFrozen(o1));
// => true true true

o2 = {answer: 42};
Object.seal(o2);
console.log(Object.isSealed(o2), !Object.isExtensible(o1), Object.isFrozen(o2));
// => true true false

An out-in transition could get stuck if the child with v-if was not yet shown and then replaced with a different child. In this case, ""afterLeave"" would never get fired, thus ""_leaving"" stayed true indefinitely. This was likely to happen with vue-router and asynchronous data loading before the new page is shown.

```

Did not make an issue for this, but would be nice to have this implemented.
To avoid warnings when integrating web components within Vue (e.g. polymer, ionic 4 / stenciljs), we currently need to add them to [ignoredElements](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#ignoredElements).
I think it would be a nice addition if we would be able to use a wildcard there, for example:

`Vue.config.ignoredElements = ['ion*']`

instead of 

`Vue.config.ignoredElements = ['ion-app', 'ion-header', 'ion-page', 'ion-toolbar', etc....]`


All tests pass: 
```
86 specs, 0 failures
Finished in 0.698 seconds

```
If there are better ways to implement this functionality (e.g. regex), let me know.

HerringtonDarkholme,6391,pending,Further improve Vue type declarations for canonical usage,closed,2017-08-17,"This pull request supersedes #5887 .

Key improvements:
1.  More backward compatible via generic default
2. Props type inference

@ktsn @kaorun343 @DanielRosenwasser Your reviews or suggestions are welcome!

--------------

This section provides more background for other reviewers/readers.

Vue + TS users currently need helper library like vue-component-class to provide alternative API for TypeScript. Alternative API uses code pattern that TypeScript recognizes, but it splits Vue community.

Thankfully, TypeScript introduces [ThisType](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/14141) which can greatly improve Vue's canonical API. This PR introduces ThisType to Vue's official typing.

More importantly, this  improvement also benefits **JavaScript users**! VSCode users or Vue-language-server users exploits TypeScript compiler to provide editor services for JavaScript. Thus the typing improvement can help JavaScript completion more intelligent.

Goal:
1. Provide good enough completions for both JS users and new TS users (if they use canonical API).
2. Don't break existing TS libraries or projects. Or, make breaking minimal.

Non Goal:
1. This PR won't provide 100% typing precision or use case coverage. Such typing would be too prohibitive for both maintainers and users to reason.
2. Checking errors in JS isn't kept in mind. So changing existing JS to TS will cause errors.

Known limitations:
1. `new Vue()` wouldn't return a type with props type. This is caused by compiler limitations.
2. Props typing uses a hacky trick.
3. returning properties on this might trigger cyclic error, manual annotation is needed.
4. Prop type's union type declaration like `oneProp: [String, User]` might not work without manual annotation.

Next step:
Since we already has a canonical Vue API in TS, next we can ship tsx support in the official repo.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6391,"['package.json', 'types/index.d.ts', 'types/options.d.ts', 'types/test/augmentation-test.ts', 'types/test/options-test.ts', 'types/test/plugin-test.ts', 'types/test/tsconfig.json', 'types/test/vue-test.ts', 'types/tsconfig.json', 'types/vue.d.ts']",2017-10-06 18:45:14,,"@HerringtonDarkholme thanks for taking this over! At this moment, I think we also need to have a clear list of potential actions required for existing TS+Vue users once we ship this in 2.5, since it would be an implicit upgrade. Will it be simply upgrading TS/vuex/vue-router to latest at the same time, or would it require code changes for specific features?@yyx990803  Thanks for the quick response! 

I have tried with vue-class-component, vuex and vue-router. The result is rather positive.
All three projects can trivially be upgraded, compatible with the new typing. See the detailed diff below.

Though not seamless, the upgrade usually requires only import styles changing, from `import * as Vue from 'vue'` to `import Vue from 'vue'`. The only one exception I have countered is using Vue as namespace. `Vue.ComponentOption` needs to be changed to `import {ComponentOption} from ""vue""`, then directly using the import.


We might still break some advanced usage. But **generally, for both terminal users and library authors, updating import style is probably the only thing they need to do**. If they have already turned on `allowSyntheticDefaultImport` option, like we have suggested in the doc, Vue2.5 probably will be a seamless upgrade. (e.g. [av-ts](https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme/av-ts) test cases all passed after upgrading, without any code change)

Advanced usages still needs case by case discussion, if we can find any.

> One change seems to fix a bug not found before

Yeah, it was because of updating TypeScript version. (and the previous code seems invalid)

This improvement is really great! It looks to be compatible in the most of use cases that I can think and also solves `props` type inference that is one of the most challenging topic of Vue typings üòÑ 

I need a bit more time to take a look into this. Will try it on this weekend üôÇ I realized weird behavior when I include `props`, `render` option in `Vue.extend`.

```js
Vue.extend({

  props: {
    bar: {
      type: String
    }
  },

  methods: {
    foo() {}
  },

  mounted () {
    this.foo()
  },

  render (h) {
    const a = this.bar

    // if including `[a]`, `this.foo()` in `mounted` failed to type check
    return h('canvas', {}, [a])
  }
})
```

@ktsn Thanks for review!

The last example is, sadly, that ThisType is very easy to trigger cyclic dependency, as listed in the known issue. 
The fix is also easy, manually annotate the return type of render will fix this.@HerringtonDarkholme 
Oh, that's sad üò¢ 
Maybe, we should suggest users to always write type annotations in the docs.I just summarize required actions for migration. 

* Rewrite import statement to default import `import Vue from 'vue'`
* Rewrite namespace usage to named import (e.g. `Vue.ComponentOptions` to just `ComponentOptions`)
* Change `namespace Vue` to `interface VueConstructor` when module augmentation.
* ThisType of `computed`, `watch`, `render` and lifecycle hooks will need manual type annotations if the users annotate their component options with `as ComponentOptions<Something>`.

I guess, the most users can migrate to the new typings by just rewriting `import` statement. The 2nd/3rd things may need for some plugin developers (or someone well understanding Vue typings). The users that manually annotate their component options need to do the 4th thing but I guess the most of TS+Vue users use class style API (like vue-class-component), so it would ba a few cases.@ktsn 

I'm a little confused,  with this type desecration improvement,  TypeScript compiler could understand the code below ( almost understand )?
I mean it can understand `foo` method and `bar` property?

```
Vue.extend({

  props: {
    bar: {
      type: String
    }
  },

  methods: {
    foo() {}
  },

  mounted () {
    this.foo()
  },

  render (h) {
    const a = this.bar

    // if including `[a]`, `this.foo()` in `mounted` failed to type check
    return h('canvas', {}, [a])
  }
})
```Do be careful to test out cases with the call signatures; I realize now that `Array` and `RegExp` has both construct and call signatures.@HerringtonDarkholme are you on slack? Can you give an email address so I can invite you to the team slack? (maybe via Twitter DM)I drafted a blog post regarding the 2.5 TS upgrade, feedback needed!

* ""So that we"" doesn't flow will into the items listed
* The features we added that enabled this support were chiefly in 2.1 to 2.3.@yyx990803 @HerringtonDarkholme @DanielRosenwasser any changes to Vue typings due to TS 2.6 release?@eshimischi if you're having any specific problems with the type declarations given TypeScript 2.6, I'd suggest you file a separate issue.","We should keep this line to test `ComponentOptions` augmentation?Can we let `value` type to `T` since we can infer prop type now?Looks like ThisType of `computed`, `watch`, `render` and lifecycle hooks will be invalid if the users annotate their component options with `as ComponentOptions<Something>`.
Can we deal with in that case too?This is clever declaration :DMaybe, we need to keep `WatchHandler`'s ThisType?Type assertion like `{ opt: ...} as Option` would not bring type inference to the declaration. 
Users have to annotate Vue.extend or casting `this`.The point of validator is testing `any`thing if it is of type T, so `any` is more appropriate here.I see. Then I think we should stated about this in docs for migration üôÇ But at least its type is specified by `type` option, isn't it?
The other types than `type` is not come here on runtime.Hmm. We cannot reuse WatchHandler because explicit this typing will break ThisType. Just write a new function type will be fine.Indeed, I forget there is builtin check before validator!Oops, unintentional deletion during refactoring. Thanks for pointing out!Instead of this global augmentation ~~hack~~ trick, the `Boolean`/`String`/`Number` constructors all already have call signatures that return `boolean`, `string`, and `number` respectively. So you could potentially write

```ts
export type Prop<T> = { (): T } | { new (...args: any[]): T & object }
```Indeed! It works!I think ThisType of `beforeCreate` should be extended component type because there are cases that we want to intialize additional data in it.Having tried this out, while `Props` inference is great, I think there will be cases where someone will want to write an `interface` for `props` and then let `Data`, `Methods`, and `Computed` be inferred on their own, and then let 

Maybe we should reorder this so that `Props` comes first? something like

```ts
extend<Props = Record<PropNames, any>, PropNames extends string = never, Data = {}, Methods = {}, Computed = {}>(options?: ThisTypedComponentOptionsWithArrayProps<V, Data, Methods, Computed, PropNames>): ExtendedVue<V, Data, Methods, Computed, Props>;
extend<Props = {}, Data = {}, Methods = {}, Computed = {}>(options?: ThisTypedComponentOptionsWithRecordProps<V, Data, Methods, Computed, Props>): ExtendedVue<V, Data, Methods, Computed, Props>;
```

What do you think @HerringtonDarkholme?I wonder if inferring default generic parameter is available in current TS.  https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14400 or this comment https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/13487#issuecomment-274214745

So users have to annotate all the type parameters as long as they want to specify at least one parameter.Unfortunately we haven't yet implemented that. This isn't a blocker though.I'm merging this in preparation for 2.5 release. We can improve upon this in a separate PR later.We were using this pattern below

```ts
interface AppComponent extends Store, Vue {
  // Additional typed props besides ones defined on Store here
}

export default {
// ...
} as ComponentOptions<AppComponent>
```

but it looks like this isn't possible with Vue 2.5 no more. Is there another way to type your props now? Possible workaround is to wrap props inside computed property with added type, but this isn't really elegant."

In case of components that can work both as standalone and as children, it would be nice to be able to provide default values for the not provided dependencies.
It would also avoid the warning for missing inject in case this is one of the expected use case.

```
<input @keyup.alt.plain=""fire"" >
```

Or is not the purpose of this PR to introduce this?@asumaran `plain` will prevent the event if any modifier key is pressed, including `alt`. You can handle that your self easily in a custom function though üôÇ @posva Thanks, I misunderstood the real issue üëç Is `.plain` the best word choice here? Somehow feels there could be something more elegant...My English is not goodüôÇ, and I can only think of ```pure```„ÄÅ```unmixed``` or ```solo```.Even though I approved the change, @nickmessing made it clear that he isn't convinced either by the name either. We should think about it and we'll probably have a better name in a few days

on top of my head I can think about `no-modifiers` but `modifier` is also the name of that thing and  after seeing many issues about misunderstanding the meaning of the modifier `.prop` (because it looks like `props`), I don't think using the word _modifier_ is a good idea üòÜ But I don't know any other worrd to define alt, ctrl & company""bare"" maybe? A bare event seems to make sense meaning nothing additional@posva, actually, I really like `.no-modifiers` because that's what actually is (but we have vue's event modifiers too), maybe you could just do a poll with the members of core team to find out which one is reasonable? It would be generally useful to have a `.not` modifier or defined prefixes to negate all existing modifiers.

Alternatively it would be ok if one could simple re-emit the event and define multiple handlers like such:

`<div @contextmenu.ctrl=""$emit($event)"" @contextmenu.prevent.stop=""$refs.menu.open($event)""></div>`

This code actually works, but logs an error of course (because $event param should be a string but then it doesn't work).

If this worked the first `@contextmenu.ctrl` would cause the normal browser context menu when `ctrl` modifier is used. The second definition causes the other callback to e.g open a custom menu. 

the `not` modifier is not possible at the moment. But adding too many modifiers make things super complicated. When you have 3 modifiers it's often time to do the filtering of keys in the bound function@posva, I actually like the idea of `not` modifier, it's going to be harder to implement but I love using `:not` in CSS, can we consider having `.not(.ctrl.shift)` as a syntax?@posva what about a way to at least declare two handlers as in my example without causing exceptions in order to re-emit non-handled cases.  It will be a question of specificity of course.

Or is there another way to cleanly re-emit bubbling native events (the fact that component events don't bubble is not ideal anyway, but that is another topic)@nickmessing It could be added but I personally feel like it's too much because those modifiers generate js code atm, which makes things different from the order. IMO, it's better to write the actual javascript.

@matthiasg I'd add one single event handler and do the checks there@posva sure we could do that, but in our architecture, we try to get most basic stuff done in the html or at the very least without specifics of structures like the html/dom eventing system. Vue and angular before are interesting to us, because they do not try to force people to use javascript for everything and our customers can follow at their own pace. 

as for the specifics of ordering, a single prefixed `not` would be sufficient in my view, since it fills an obvious gap and there is no alternative to say do this when ctrl is pressed and do this when it doesn't match. If duplicate handlers were properly supported a `not` might not be necessary. But as it is now, I think it is syntactically incomplete due to implicitly ignoring all non defined modifiers.@matthiasg, `.not` in the way I described means a complete re-implementation of event modifiers. I kinda like the idea but I would vote *no* for it. `.plain` (or what name we're going to use) is enough for most use cases, if you need something more specific you better do that in methods./ping @posva, @kazupon, @blake-newman, @Kingwl

Any ideas what we do with this? Is `.no-key-modifier` the best name we end up with?I think @hworld made a better proposition with _bare_
edit: We'll wait for @yyx990803 input on this. It's something that can wait anyway (because it can already be achieved)`.default`?@nickmessing  How about a new event modifier `.just` to check if the event is ""just"" a specific key, or keys. It would make it an exact match.
`@keyup.just.shift` is just shift
`@keyup.just.enter` is just enter@JoshFisk  Then I guess
`@keyup.shift.only` is more reasonable.@dsonet Yeah, "".only"" works better. It is easy to understand, regardless of the order.
@keyup.only.shift
@keyup.shift.only
@dsonet, @JoshFisk, that would mean a pretty big change in the way modifiers are implemented, the easy way would be to add `.only-shift` and others but I don't think it's reasonable. I think you should open another issue to discuss that and to get team's feedback. I never need that one and I don't see real value in that but if you can provide good usecases maybe it can be considered.@nickmessing It could initially support normal keys, but be expanded to support modifiers in the future. A common use is showing valid shortcut keys when you hold a modifier. This is commonly done with the Alt key, and menus.
"".bare"" would have the same issue if it was not supported.
@keyup.bare.shift@JoshFisk, I will try to find an easy way of making `.bare` work with current modifiers so `v-on:keyup.enter.bare.shift` works like ""if it's enter and shift is pressed and other modifiers are not pressed"". Is that what you're looking for?@nickmessing 
More like this:
""If enter and shift are pressed and no other key, or modifier on the keyboard is pressed"".

Here are two example problems:

1. Lets say you bind Y to Yes, and N to No, and have a span that holds the users choice called Answer.
If the user pushes Y, and N at the same time you might want the answer to be Maybe, or for nothing to happen.

2. You are making a help pop up page. ""Ctrl H"" brings up the help page, but advanced users can press ""Ctrl H 3"" to go directly to  section 3 of the help page.","Can you remove everything from `packages`? Those files are generated üôÇ Oh, sorry, didn't know"

I've found it easier to debug my application if I use:

Vue.config.errorHandler = function(err, vm, info) {throw err};

Unfortunately, I found that my error handler wasn't being called if the error was encountered as a result of updating a reactive element.  Tracing back, I found that this was due to nextTick calling console.error directly instead of handleError.  I made this change locally and found that it fixed my problem, and didn't cause any failures with 'npm test'.

When mentioning certain library names like `vueify` and `vue-loader`, the documentation uses backticks in some places but not in others.  Of the cases I noticed, most were in links.  GitHub permits backticks within links and they are rendered with the fixed-width fontQ

The main README.md omits them for vue-loader.  To show the difference, I took the specific line from the table and included both forms:

Hanks10100,6620,weex,[weex] Adjust the weex platform entry file to fit the new weex runtime,closed,2017-09-16,"> These changes will only affect the Weex platform, and will not affect any features on the web.

### Remove the `new Function` hack for V8

Remove the `callFunctionNative` method and the `compileBundle` API which is provided by modified V8.
In order to maintain the consistency of the js engine, Weex also uses JSC on Android. The legacy hack for V8 engine should be removed.

### Move shared APIs to Weex runtime

Modules and components should be registered in weex runtime, not in each front-end frameworks. The
`registerModules`, `registerComponents`, `weex.supports` and `weex.requireModule` APIs is moved to
Weex runtime which is in the https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex .

### Use `document` instead of `renderer`

We are going to migrate to CircleCI 2.0 with #6041, but with a simpler description, we can make the build run time shorter.

When caching node_modules, the build is now finished in 1 minute 20 seconds.
https://circleci.com/workflow-run/7ea0d4e0-48ca-449d-9a52-9880dbbd93a5

While this introduces a slight behavior change, I believe the only scenario in which this would cause breakage is if an application has a non-reactive object inside of a non-reactive array and is relying on the reactivity system to detect changes to the elements in that array. This seems incredibly unlikely to happen as that use case has already gone to lengths to opt out of reactivity in the first place, so I expect this to be nothing but a performance improvement for those use cases if they exist.

I did some tests and it seems to work nicely üëç Doing some perf checks and it looks like the old version is faster though üòÜ 
edit ah nevermind, it looks like there's no difference @posva  
I just do a simple test, and this is the [link](https://jsperf.com/vue-hyphenate). It shows the new version is faster, but I only run the test in my environment (chrome 60.0.3112 + windows 10). 
In addition,  regular replacement once should be faster than twice, both the two regular are simple after all (I'm not sure if this is right).
So, how do you do the performance tests?
Sorry for maybe not having made my expression accurately, cause my English is not very good.Technically this is a breaking change. What counts as a word is listed in http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.10.2.6. While an identifier can contain `$` and other unicode characters. 

`hyphenateOld('$Naughty')` gets `$-naughty`, the new one gets `$naughty`.

But using dollar sign is not recommended in Vue. I think this change should be good.@HerringtonDarkholme 
Thanks for your reminder. You're right, the new one can be keep consistent with the old when the parameter belongs to `\w` (it only contains `a-zA-Z0-9_`)

But I'm not sure if the parameter should contain `$` or other unicode characters, so it may need to discuss whether this change is necessary. ","can you undo this change?@posva  Sorry about that, I have already undo this change :)"

Due to the nature of `nativescript-vue` we have to use some code from the `src` directory. 

I am here to ask if there is a better approach to our problem, than importing directly from `src`? 

As for this change, I have tried installing directly through GitHub, using either a tag, or a commit hash, but in all cases I got the version without the `src` directory.  Do you have any suggestions how to move forward with this change?Ah, yeah I realized that problem. Will revert it in a later release.",

  if (refs[key].indexOf(ref)) {
    refs[key].push(ref)
  }
}
```
So I added a `suppress_comment` option to `.flowconfig`."

This PR is an update to the README file to include the Vue Land chat hosted by Discord. üòÑ  Although @egoist has mentioned the chat on Twitter I thought it'd be a good idea to include it in the README so new and old Vue developers know about the resource. Also, I added badges for both the Discord and Gitter chats.

Sorry for not following the ""Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it."" rule, no loss on my side if you don't want to accept this.

I would like this feature as it will allow Vue to call a user provided callback for `warn`ings which helps for asserting the state of warnings during testing or development, without having to either spyon or monkeypatch the `console.error` function.

You can also setup the `watch` property on the `beforeAll`Made the suggested changeSo I finally took a proper look at this issue - since the error is caused by native `watch` on `Object.prototype`  (which is a function), I think the proper fix would be adding the following at the top of the function:

``` js
if (typeof parentVal === 'function') {
  parentVal = null
}
if (typeof childVal === 'function') {
  childVal = null
}
```

Essentially, ignore if the value is `Object.prototype.watch`. The test case will need to be updated accordingly.@yyx990803 I've added a new test for merging multiple layers of extends (I wasn't sure if it was more appropriate in the watch tests or the extends tests) - this causes the issue where child is wrapped multiple times. I am happy to make your change however this second test case will fail with your recommendation but work with the initial fix.IMO the initial fix was correct.The core reason caused bug was because it deal with the child value inconsistently. With the fix it can deal with it correctly. "

chrisnicola,5709,,Add handleError during event handling,closed,2017-05-19,"Currently handleError is used to handle errors during lifecycle hooks and component rendering. This handles most errors thrown by the component however event handlers are not handled. So a component like:

```
<template>
  <button @click=""error()"">I Throw Errors</button>
</template>

<script>
  {
    methods: {
      error() { throw new Error('thrown!'); }
    }
  }
</script>
```

Will simple throw an error and the error will never be passed to `handleError` nor is one able to use `Vue.config.errorHandler` for error reporting. For my specific use case I wanted to make sure that the plugin I use to report errors to Honeybadger would catch and report errors in event handlers, but more generally any error reporting that relies on `errorHandler` will require this.

It makes sense to me that, for consistency, Vue would want to handle errors in event handlers the same way as is done lifecycle hooks and rendering. This is consistent with the changes requested and completed in #5198 and #4370.

As this is my first PR, I hope these changes are up to the code standard for the project, but if there is anything else needed just let me know and I'll fix it.

If yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:

While it is unlikely any running apps would have depended on this behaviour. This introduces a change which will result in exceptions thrown by event handlers to be handled by `handleError` and any function assigned to `Vue.config.errorHandler`. Since errors are not re-thrown by `handleError` any code that was depending on errors in events not being handled could theoretically break. I thought it would be worthwhile to note this.

IMHO a `bundle` is either a `string` or an `object`.We can even refine `type` to a precise list of file type listed [here](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-destination).

Might be an overkill.Note server side directive will have different implementation. http://ssr.vuejs.org/en/api.html#directives
https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/d333a498e93acf2d2844fd396e8544658958a3c6/src/server/render.js#L308

IMHO direcitives will be 

```ts
 [key: string]: (vnode: VNode, dir: VNodeDirective) => void
````vnode` is inferred as `HTMLElement``err` is nullable, if user turns on `strictNullChecks` TS will wrongly report `if (err === null) {}` as unreachable error.
(edit: strangely it does not report in 2.3.3)

https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/d333a498e93acf2d2844fd396e8544658958a3c6/src/server/create-renderer.js#L74

While `html` is also nullable, I think it is more desirable to declare it as `string` since users should use it after checking `err`. Declaring `html` as nullable will force users to unnecessarily recheck because TS cannot relate two variables in flow control :( > While html is also nullable, I think it is more desirable to declare it as string

I agree. `html` should be `string` for convenience.I thought about that but not sure how benefit we can acquire by declaring it as string literal types. If the benefit is trivial, we can leave it as `string` for the simplicity of declarations?Oops, I totally didn't know about that, thanks üòÖ I'll update this option to `object` too.Indeed, spec change and implementation oddity will be more problematic.

If the latter then there could be race conditions. This may be worth an investigation. Based on this answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8996852/load-and-execute-order-of-scripts

The reason I submitted this PR is that I often have trouble finding the Vue docs.
When googling I click the Vue github repo link by default. 
When landing on the github repo I am confused as to where the docs are.
Currently there **is** a link to the documentation site, however it is not very noticeable.
In order to make it **more** noticeable and easier for other developers to find, I have moved the link to the documentation under it's own heading.

This will make it easier for developers to quickly find a link to the Vue documentation from the github repo.

Now when using `render function` skip to set the key.
@gebilaoxiong , but all array in hand-written render function will not get a key, I don't know whether it is a good solution.@pengchongfu 

I think this happens only when there are nested arrays in children

just like:

```javascript
children: [
  [vnode, vnode...]
]
```

In the `render` of the template, it will be treated as `v-for`

but `slot` and` render function` will also can generate this structure

so we just skip to set the key
@pengchongfu wait, I have a better way to solve this problemÔºÅ@pengchongfu 

I marked the `v-for` generated elements

Only `v-for` generated elements will be set `key`

avoid `render function` and` slot` to generate the same structure cause the error@yyx990803 

Well, it looks like I'm the last one waiting for today

In addition to deleting the code, do we have other ways to solve this problem? üòÑ   @yyx990803 

Fix bug is really a very interesting thing

Maybe my level is not enough, need to chew and get the truthI pushed a commit to ensure `nestedIndex` is always passed down for nested arrays. This is necessary in cases where there are two `v-for` lists nested under non `v-for` arrays, e.g.

``` js
[[[v-for list], ..., [[v-for list]]]
```understand, thank you very much","`_renndered` is set when `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`.

and not only slot, hand-written render functions could have this problem too.@pengchongfu 

I did not find any problems in the ` render function`

html:
```html
 <div id=""app""></div>
```
javascript: 
``` javascript
var vm = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    count: 1
  },
  render: function (h) {
    var list = []

    for (var i = 0; i < this.count; i++) {
      list.push(h('span', [this.count]))
    }

    return h('div', [
      list,
      h('input', {attrs: { 
        value: 'a',
        type: 'text'
      }})
    ])
  }
})
```
You can input something in the input box,
then modify the value of `count` in the console

and input`s value did not changed
@pengchongfu 

Can you give me a example about `hand-written render functions`? üåπ @gebilaoxiong , [demo](https://jsfiddle.net/Lzxnmn9p/), hack... maybe we should ignore it üòÇ

and `_rendered` is not set in production, see this [line](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/instance/render-helpers/render-slot.js#L24)
@pengchongfu 

üíã  Thanks , I'll take a look at this questionInstead of adding a property to every vnode, we can simply mark the `ret` array here with something like:

``` js
if (isDef(ret)) {
  (ret: any)._isVList = true // work around flow
}
```

Then check `children._isVList` in `normalizeArrayChildren`."

I think this PR is fine other than probably needing an `isFalse` helper.@blake-newman Agree, I have added it beside the `isTrue` method.I'll ping @yyx990803 to see if he can review to ensure that everything is covered and there are no other possible side affects.

When exploring [css-in-js solutions](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js) for vue, I came across the fact that some auto prefixed style objects (for example, by [postcss-js](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-js)) cannot be directly used as `style` option on elements, when they have an array as value, e.g.
```
{ display: ['-webkit-box', '-webkit-flex', '-ms-flexbox', 'flex'] }
```
...which happens when a rule value needs to be prefixed, other examples:
```
{ backgroundImage: ['radial-gradient(...)', '-webkit-radial-gradient(...)']

I ran all test locally. I'm having some failures related to SSR and selenium which appear to be completely unrelated. I've confirmed the new test works by reverting my change and adding it back in.


I am using `noop` for the getter if one does not exist to avoid exceptions when calling functions on the getter.
",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5267,"['src/core/instance/state.js', 'test/unit/features/options/computed.spec.js']",2017-03-27 02:41:30,,"#5265 [Here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/406352baba459288473915218b0ee81cf8066898#diff-cb87aa7890fa694dd923ea9f162256d2L137) is the change that changed the behavior. Notice on this line that `noop` is used if `get` is falsy. Does anybody think that this original behavior is preferable to the warning?

```
const getter = typeof userDef === 'function' ? userDef : (userDef.get || noop)
```

This would be consistent with how [`defineComputed()`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/0bb529a275072b9a99f645338a8c1f13439caa96/src/core/instance/state.js#L172) is defined here when the `get` is undefined. 

IMO this is better because it would not cause errors in production mode, avoid a new warning, keep the 
2.1.* behavior, and make the behavior between production and non-production modes consistent.

-------
Alternatively, I think it may be possible to avoid creating a Watcher if `get` is not defined, although I think this is a edge case. 

```
watchers[key] = getter ? new Watcher(vm, getter, noop, computedWatcherOptions) : null
```","What about saying: ""No getter function has been defined for computed property `${key}`.""
I don't think we need this.Can you wrap the if in a non-prod if please? (`if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production')`)Should only the warning be wrapped? I think getter should be assigned to noop regardless of whether it is in production mode or not, so that the behavior is consistent.I don't think it's necessary to have a fallback on production because we'd get the error at runtime, so wrapping the whole if looks better imo. It'll also prevent an unnecessary check for all computed properties```js
if(process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' && !getter) {
  // warning
}
```
might be betterI don't think so. Former is better as define plugin would replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` with `'production'` and it can be stripped off.both are stripped off actually"

Since arrays can be treated as normal objects in JavaScript and contain a mix of numeric and named properties, this patch makes `Vue.set` and `Vue.del` deal correctly with named properties on reactive arrays.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5216,"['src/core/observer/index.js', 'test/unit/modules/observer/observer.spec.js']",2017-03-23 07:12:31,,"I'm not sure if this is a good idea - custom properties on Arrays are ignored during JSON.stringify and cannot be persisted. I personally would never rely on them.I'm confused -- what do reactive properties have to do with persistence?  I certainly don't do this often myself, but it's occasionally useful to pass metadata through an API/SPI where you control both ends but can only transmit an array through the library.  IMHO the principle that you can safely replace any member assignment with a call to `Vue.set` outweighs trying to ""fix"" iffy JavaScript semantics.@pkaminski yeah, I guess it doesn't matter that much. I'm just thinking about the implications this has to do with normal persistence scenarios and in particular Vuex snapshots.Honestly, I don't even care if the resulting named array property is reactive (though I think it should be for consistency), I'd just like `Vue.set` not to crash when invoked with an array target and a string key.Thanks!","I can't understand this change. Could you explain?I can't say I understand it either, but without this cast Flow complains that `Array doesn't have an __ob__ property` -- why it decided that `target` is an array, I don't know.  It appears to be an instance of [this Flow issue](https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/1330), though my knowledge of Flow is minimal so I can't tell for sure."

Would @znck please also give a look?One thing I don't want with provide/inject is child modifying ancestor's data.

If `foo` is injected & reactive then setting `this.foo = null` would set the provided prop to `null`. IMO that could be problematic.

Injected properties were kept non-reactive intentionally. Perhaps @yyx990803 could explain better.https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html#updating-context

> React has an API to update context, but it is fundamentally broken and you should not use it.

should we warn when the context is changedÔºüCurrently, reactive objects can be provided. 

https://jsfiddle.net/m0fyr6z1/3/ - In this example, you see, child re-renders if array is changed in parent component.

IMO, rather than setting provided injections (current implementation) or defining reactive injections (this PR), it would be better to add enumerable, non-configurable & read-only injections./ping @yyx990803 ‚Äì Your input required.`defineReactive` accepts a fourth argument (customSetter) which allows overriding the default set behavior. We can just use that to do the warning when a child component attempts to mutate an injection binding. This is what we are doing for props too: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/instance/state.js#L71-L91Overriding the setter makes this PR introduce a BC.
It doesn't because it was not reactive anyway.In the project I'm working on, I did the following:

```js
export default {
  inject: ['_searchStore'],
  props: {
    searchStore: {
      type: Object,
      default () {
        return this._searchStore
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which will now break if I'm not mistaken.",make sure to prefix warnings with `process.env.NODE_ENV` check :)done

SSR `v-show` directive should be merged from parent to child component.

It could be reproduced via this [github repo](https://github.com/defcc/v-show-ssr-bug/). 

And the demo code is bellow:

```js
var Vue = require('vue/dist/vue.common.js')
var createRenderer = require('vue-server-renderer').createRenderer
var renderToString = createRenderer().renderToString

const vm = new Vue({
  template: `
    <foo v-show=""false""></foo>
  `,
  components: {
    foo: {
      render: h => h('bar'),

        bar: {
          render: h => h('div', 'inner')
        }
      }
    }

  }
})

renderToString(vm, (err, res) => {
  console.log(res)
})
```

The result is `<div server-rendered=""true"">inner</div>`, it should be `<div server-rendered=""true"" style=""display:none;"">inner</div>`

Hi,

Please see #5145 

This patch adds a warning when user is not passing props in kebab-case mistakenly, for example:

```html
<foo someProp=""bar""></foo>
should be
<foo some-prop=""bar""></foo>
```

I know this is stated on the guide, but since it's a very common mistake (based on the questions on stackoverflow (see the issue above) [and the](https://forum.vuejs.org/t/unable-to-pass-data-from-parent-to-child-component/1763/1) [forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/t/need-help-with-passing-a-boolean-prop-to-a-comonent/3996/1 )), I think it is worth to add a warning and I believe this will save a lot of people's debugging time and provide a more friendly development experience.

And for the performance, this is not a complex algorithm. It only adds a fews operations (both `toLowerCase` and `hasOwnProperty` are fast enough) in O(n) so I would say the impact on performance is negligible (almost no impact when running unit test on my machine).

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one with ""x"")

```

**Other information**:
In #5029 I outlined how the bootstrap library that is used in the dbmon benchmark references font files that are not included in the repo.
Rather than including them in the repo I thought a better approach would be to customize the bootstrap library to only include exactly what the benchmark actually needed.

The customization options are stored, by bootstrap, in the minified file. For quick reference you can find it [here.](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/?id=7bd1d75ceeb95d343d9e16d305e782cd)

Size of the library goes from 102KB to 49KB.

This resolves my original problem as the ""Glyphicons"" module of bootstrap is no longer included and the references to fonts have been removed from the library.

#### Update based on comments:
This PR now removes the bootstrap library that the js-repaint-perfs library was using in favour of using the `styles.css` that the library now uses.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5123,"['benchmarks/dbmon/index.html', 'benchmarks/dbmon/lib/bootstrap.min.css', 'benchmarks/dbmon/lib/styles.css']",2017-03-09 01:23:20,,"FYI the bootstrap file used was directly copied from https://github.com/mathieuancelin/js-repaint-perfs , but they have since removed the dependency on bootstrap.

KingMario,5039,,Add the runtime-only warning for el in-DOM HTML template,closed,2017-02-28,"Make the warning more explicit for template complier.
Plus, el option which will be used to extract the template should also emit the warning.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5039,['src/core/instance/lifecycle.js'],2017-03-03 04:11:53,,"`el` is also used in runtime only:

```js
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  render: h => h(App)
})
```

edit: my bad, I thought this was another warning@posva, The warning is emitted when there's no render function (handwritten or compiled), so it's no problem whether `el` is used or not in runtime only.

The developer might use a template that he wants to use standalone build to compile it, but for some reason he used runtime-only build.

The key problem is that templates live in both `template` option and `el` elements' in-DOM HTML, not only in `template` option. This is not explicit pointed in the whole documentation, so I guess we should add this in the documentation too.

An example is here: [Runtime-only Build Caused Bug](https://github.com/KingMario/think-in-vue/tree/ba83d296ee384c495a79f0024cf891b2acd0f0ad/standalone-vs-runtime-only-build/project). 

Go to the [Example Result](https://kingmario.github.io/think-in-vue/standalone-vs-runtime-only-build/0/) and see the console log in developer's tool. The developer will get 

> Failed to mount component: template or render function not defined.

which is really confusing.
@KingMario You're right, I didn't look the code above and thought this warning was a different one (`Failed to mount component: template or render function not defined`)Can you add a test then, please?Test added. Also added npm run build in ci.sh. But don't know whether it's acceptable.@KingMario I just realised there're no tests for that, sorry. I removed the extra commits and added a check for `el`",

HerringtonDarkholme,4892,,use vm.Script to avoid reparse,closed,2017-02-09,"DISCLAIMER: I don't have enough knowledge in nodejs nor V8. I read most cpp/internal js  is by guessing and cramming on cppreference.com :/  I welcome any correction!

This pr tries to alleviate the problem in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4872. When users include third party library into server bundle, the parsing overhead can be smaller.

If user provided global variable is compared with another global variable in library code, they will never be equal because they are executed in different context.

To fix this generally, we have to run library code and user code in the same context. This means we need to parse a lot of code in one request. 

We can skip parsing by creating a `Script` object, and `runInNewContext` is [effectively a shortcut](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/5de3cf099cd01c84d1809dab90c041b76aa58d8e/lib/vm.js#L62-L65). Thus it is safe to reuse the `Script` object.

Reusing `Script` should save several C++ call and reduce garbage collection pressure since the underlying C++ object has a [`Persistent`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/5de3cf099cd01c84d1809dab90c041b76aa58d8e/src/node_contextify.cc#L461) which will not be collected until [out of memory](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/5080) (it is cargo cult to me, though).

However, I **cannot see a performance improvement** in a simple benchmark,  regardless of whether bundling library code into server entry. (I use vue-hackernews as example, tested under `ab -n 1000 -c 100`).
It seems v8 will [cache compiled code](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/30224360c10ddd065f46eb81fffa69b88e5378d2/src/compiler.cc#L1571-L1573). So parsing overhead is relatively ignorable in real world.

But reusing object is still a good practice, so I submitted this pull request for symbolic value.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/4892,"['src/server/create-bundle-renderer.js', 'src/server/run-in-vm.js']",2017-02-13 18:31:26,,"Looks good to me! Can we add a test case for #4872?Sadly #4872 is not fixed in this pull request üòû . It only reduce reparsing overhead so more library code can be bundled at the same cost.

If we bundle Vue library into the server bundle, #4872 can be fixed. It has been verified by existing tests.
If Vue library is required from external, #4872 will still have problem due to different execution context.

We can reduce the reparsing overhead as is done here, so bundling Vue library is less expensive. We still need users to configure their project to bundle library code together with application code if they need to use APIs which compare global variables.Ok, I guess we can adjust prop type check strategy to not rely on globals instead.",

@chrisvfritz WDYT?Since the question of how to properly build a larger app with Vue seems to pop up quite often, I'd personally suggest a ""Vue Best Practices for Large Apps"" article in the docs. The advanced section is great, but it doesn't really discuss what is ""proper"" for building out a larger application with Vue.  

Scott@posva I'm in favor of just removing it for now. We've split that page up in the 2.0 docs and expanded upon each topic, so they should be able to find the same information.

@smolinari Best practices for large apps is a pretty big topic, so I think I'd like to keep it split up into more specific topics. If there's important information missing though, I'd love to hear more - though probably in a new issue at vuejs/vuejs.org, as I think it's a separate discussion.@chrisvfritz - agreed. A ""Best Practices for Large Apps"" could be its own major section of the manual. 

I'll start a topic in the forum to ask for feedback and possible sub-topics.

The primary reason for the use of `any`s is usually because the original code was written in plain ES2015 without typing in mind. The flow types were later added on. In many cases, we can make assumptions about certain type scenarios based on code logic, but such logic cannot be easily inferred by Flow.

HerringtonDarkholme,4299,,Ensure Vue instance's vnode and element is up to date,closed,2016-11-23,"Fix #4284 , to recap the bug, in one sentence: 

`vm.$el` should always be the same as `vm.$vnode.elm`

More detail:

1. If a component changes its root element during rendering, all ancestors' placeholder root element's element should be all updated.

2. If one component is the root element of another component, for example `wrapper` in the test case, and wrapper's parent is updated (which triggers wrapper's `updateFromParent`), `wrapper`'s $vnode is not the same as `comp`'s $vnode.parent. While in the initial rendering, these two vnodes are the same one.

To simplify these two statements, we have to keep one invariant: `vm.$el` should always be the same as `vm.$vnode.elm`. Otherwise vdom patching will mistakenly insert new dom node.

If we correctly sync vnode's element when child tree's root changes its tag (1), and update vm's vnode when parent is updated(2), we can ensure $el is up to date.

chrisvfritz,3967,in review,Add promise support to nextTick,closed,2016-10-17,"This might seem like a very naive implementation, but I _think_ it should work as expected. When we pass a callback to `nextTick`, we just defer it (ideally to the microtask queue), with our preferred strategy being native promises. In cases where promises are polyfilled, it seems projects like Bluebird actually use [very similar scheduling fallbacks](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/blob/master/src/schedule.js) to `nextTick`, so we should see similar results.
",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/3967,"['src/core/instance/render.js', 'src/core/util/env.js', 'test/unit/features/instance/methods-lifecycle.spec.js', 'test/unit/modules/util/next-tick.spec.js']",2016-11-20 14:50:38,,"LGTM
Aside from implementation details, what is the primary use case for this? Easier chaining?

My concern with this is that this makes `nextTick`'s behavior inconsistent based on the environment. E.g. code that relies on the returned Promise that works in Chrome will break in IE9 if no proper polyfill was provided.
@yyx990803 I can definitely see your point and even IE11 would break without a polyfill. I see this as an advanced usage similar to Vuex, which also relies on Promise support. The need for a polyfill in IE would also be noted prominently whenever mentioning this syntax alternative (I'm personally a fan of including the very light-weight [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v2/docs/) in every project). 

Given that, if you're afraid users might stumble upon the Promise syntax without reading the documentation on `nextTick` or realizing the limits of native Promise support, I would not be at all offended if this PR were rejected. üôÇ 

The primary use case is ergonomics - easier chaining and `async`/`await` usage:

### Promise chaining

``` js
this.fetchTodos()
  .then(this.$nextTick)
  .then(() => {
    // something that relies on the DOM being updated
  })
```

### `async`/`await`

``` js
watch: {
  todos: async () => {
    await this.$nextTick()
    // something that relies on the DOM being updated
  }
}
```

---

With the current implementation of `nextTick`, I also want to acknowledge that these are not actually new possibilities being opened, as `Promise.resolve().then` will work just as well as `Vue.nextTick().then`. However, I would argue that applications should ignore the internal implementation, since it's subject to change - and is especially likely to with other compile targets. That's why the use cases above assume `nextTick` is a magical black box.
","Out of curiosity, rationale for this instead of simply `else if (Promise)`?
With a simple `if`, this would be thrown when `Promise` is undefined:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: Promise is not defined
```
~~I think `if (window.Promise) {...}` should do.~~
Sorry, suddenly realized vue also runs on node which doesn't have window
`cb` is declared as `Function`, I would expect it as a non-nullable value. Maybe changing the cb annotation is better.
Well, if you changed cb to be nullable, then flow will report error here because it is pessimistic 
Why doesn't this return a promise?
why ctx is passed as argument, I wonder. Because `nextTick` does not modify obj, the caller of `nextTick` can always access `ctx`. If we are using `nextTick` as a `Promise` fallback in which `ctx` is wrapped and consumer does not own handle to `ctx`, it is possibly useless because we can use native `Promise`. If promise does not exist, nextTick returns `undefined` which does add much value.
Because I didn't want to encourage people to mix the two styles (passing a callback vs chaining a promise).
The it sounds like separate another API is a better choice?
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying, but are you suggesting having a separate `nextTickPromise` method or similar?
This is for `Vue.prototype.$nextTick`, which binds the context to the callback or in the case of a promise, passes the context as an argument.
Yes, exactly
I'd rather not force people to learn another method name. This convention of being able to use either a callback or a promise is also quite common, whereas I've never seen a library do as you propose.

I'm adding tests. But this fix seems to have some problems. Still under investigation.
There is still a problem left. Code like this

``` javascript
{
  template: '<section><comp :style=""style""></comp></section>',
  data: {
    style: 'color:red'
  },
  components: {
    comp: {
      template: '<div></div>'
    }
  }
}
```

Will produce code  like this
`<section server-rendered=""true""><div></div></section>`

Style is lost. This is because the inner template element `div`'s vnode has no `data`. So the module logic isn't executed at all. I have no clear idea how to fix this...
Merge conflict resolved. My concern is the `hasAncestorData` check and a new `node.data` assignment.
@yyx990803 I think you are the best one to decide solution. Otherwise this pr is ready for code review.
Yeah, I think setting empty data object is fine.

It seems the style-generating code is only checking the direct parent node, where it's possible to have multi-nested components (A renders B, B renders C...), so we need to do a parent walk loop (`while (parentNode = parentNode.parent) ...`).
I think this looks good. If the `attrs` module have a similar problem, we can do that in a separate PR.
FYI attrs/domProps modules are fixed for similar situations in e5f23d9
","`<comp>` has a synthetic `server-rendered` attrs so it has the chance to execute module logic...
Add a synthetic data property if VNode's ancestor has data. I don't this is good enough...
@yyx990803 By ""multi-nested components"", do you mean this?
Ah I see, the `generateStyleText` call is recursive, nice.

Noop, I just thought that vue should have the same behaviour in development and production enviroment except extra warnings. 
One more thing, I think this [line of code](https://github.com/jingsam/vue/blob/dev/src/core/global-api/extend.js#L32) should be deleted in Vue 2. In vue 1, `name` will be used as a function name, such as:
name='MyComponent' => function MyComponent () {this._init(options)}
However, in Vue 2, no matter what the name is, always use  `function VueComponent() {this._init(options)}`
@jingsam true, I think this PR can be changed to simply removing that line.
Ops, CI failed in this [test](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/test/unit/features/options/name.spec.js#L23-L28):`

```
  it('when incorrect name given it should not contain itself in self components', () => {
    const vm = Vue.extend({
      name: 'Hyper*Vue'
    })

    expect(vm.options.components['Hyper*Vue']).toBeUndefined()
```

In fact, in Vue 2, there are no limitations on the name of components. Even invalid name can be registered. The only limitation is whether the virtual dom  can parse the name tag into  the corresponding component. For example, `Hyper*Vue` can be registered but `<Hyper*Vue></Hyper*Vue>` can not be parsed by virtual dom correctly. `_HyperVue` is an invalid name but it works, as `<_HyperVue></_HyperVue>` can be parsed.

@yyx990803 so, shall I delete that unit test case ?
Yeah, I think that test case can be removed.

I'm sorry that this change introduced more problems than it resolved.
As @phanan pointed out, only `method` is warned against. Also https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4142 is another problem caused by this.

I have reconsidered this. We want to only warn against overriding built-in method. And using `key in vm` to detect that effectively means:
- `vm` only has properties inherited from Vue.prototype. This is guaranteed by Vue's core code, where extending is done by option merging.
- Vue.prototype does not have user defined method. This is not controlled by core code, as #4142 showed.

@phanan Could you tell me the tricky part of properties? I'm not on slack.
@HerringtonDarkholme: @yyx990803 should have a better answer because he knows best about the framework's internal obviously, but from what I can tell, not all properties have been registered by the time methods are collected (examples are `$el` and `$slots`). This would make a check during `initMethods()` incomplete and was what kept me from sending a PR over.
Yes, I just tried to fix this again and found warning is particularly tricky thing. More importantly, a `_` and `$` prefix have been strong indicators to users. The marginal benefit for this pr doesn't worth... @yyx990803 I'm so sorry make this rushy pull request. Feel free if you want to revert this.
I'll just revert this for now - I think this is a very rare case anyway. Or, we can simply change it to warn against any method that starts with `$` or `_`, since this is conventionally reserved for internal and plugin methods/properties.
Agreed. This ""improvement"" has only been costing us time with no particular benefits to start with :)
","Let rephrase this to ""Avoid overriding Vue's internaml method ..."" and can remove the second line.
Can't we just use `vm` instead of importing Vue here?
Hi, I also considered that approach when coding this. But if we use `vm` or `vm.constructor.prototype`, it will break constructor style instance because `$emit` or so isn't their own properties.

By the way: `delays` is never an empty array, so `concat()` can't end up in an infinite loop.

To be sure we could add a fallback like `delays = delays.concat(delays || '0s')` But that would mean we need to know the syntax of a delay inside the function, which could cause issues when a browser decides to change the syntax.

chrisvfritz,3943,,fix root v-else not rendering in prod and switched examples to minified vue for better prod coverage,closed,2016-10-14,"Fixes #3940. This was a bit of a brainless error on my part - I apologize. Something I noticed however, is that none of our tests are currently covering the production build of Vue, thus allowing this error to slip through. To prevent this in the future, I was wondering if we should split the unit tests into two groups:
- Development-specific behavior (e.g. warnings)
- Features that should behave the same in both dev and prod, which will perform a second run with `NODE_ENV` set to `production`

I think that work would be well outside the scope of this PR, but as a stop-gap measure to cover production at least a little, I switched all of the e2e examples to use the production build, then tweaked the grid example so that I could add a regression test. 

My thinking is that production is probably most important for e2e anyway, as devs will more quickly discover development-only errors (and they won't affect end users). The only downside I can foresee is that if someone clones the repo to start playing with examples, they won't get any nice warnings if they make a mistake. So, I added a comment above each Vue script with instructions to use the development version if they'd like. Still, I'm happy to change it back if this is undesirable. We'd just have to think of another way to add a regression test.

I was just trying out the new type definitions and had problems with importing them. I used the following alternative `index.d.ts` that worked for me in a Browserify environment before stumbling on this thread.:

``` typescript
export * from ""./vue.d"";
export * from ""./options.d"";
export * from ""./plugin.d"";
export * from ""./vnode.d"";
import {Vue} from ""./vue.d"";
export default Vue;
```

This supports several import styles and provides easy access to the other definitions besides `Vue`:

``` typescript
// just import Vue
import Vue from 'vue'
new Vue(...)

// import multiple definitions
import {Vue, ComponentOptions} from 'vue'

// import 'namespace style'
import * as Vuejs from 'vue'
new Vuejs.Vue(...)
```

What do you think?
@isotes The problem you're going to run into is that everyone represented CommonJS exports incorrectly, and so it's not clear what the ""right"" import style is going to be when the interop story is decided on. Right now, you can enable the default export behavior if you use the `--allowSyntheticDefaultImports` flag.
@DanielRosenwasser Thanks for the clarification!
","Why is this an import to `./vue.d`? It should probably just be `./vue`

",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/3425,['src/compiler/parser/index.js'],2016-08-11 16:25:59,,"Thanks for the PR - however, you should not be using Vue for rendering the entire page - because in the browser Vue will need to ""pick up"" the server-rendered DOM, so they must be consistent on both ends. Allowing `<script>` on the server will cause hydration errors on the client.

In most cases you'd wrap the markup rendered from your app with surrounding head/tail markup to make it a complete HTML page.
Yes, I know, but with the appropriate setup it still works very well without any effort:

Please take a look on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/naumovs/6fe32db51d4ee81c7cc6a66270233241).

There are two entry points for server and for the client. The server renderer just sets the server-rendered attribute to the main component from the client-index.js and client picks up rendered content. I feel like it is amazing to drop off other thirdparty templating systems if everything can be done with Vue
@naumovs ah, yeah that's a pretty neat idea!

Or is that done somewhere else generally?
@LinusBorg There's a [separate warning](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue/blob/f1a16e5703c60131387e0b163a2b0dc40ae228f8/src/compiler/parser/index.js#L138-L143) for `v-for` on root, which is triggered whether or not a `v-if` exists.
I saw that but was unsure weither it only applies if there _is_ one root item.
@LinusBorg Just confirmed with another test locally that this:

```
<div v-if=""1"" v-for=""i in [1]""></div><div v-else></div>
```

does indeed warn about `v-for`, but root constraints were _not_ being applied to the 2nd element with `v-else`. Added a test for it and fixed the issue. üëç 
It perhaps should be noted that the following will currently NOT trigger a warning:

``` vue
<p v-if=""0""></p>
<p v-else></p>
<p v-else></p>
```

But I consider this a separate issue, since this doesn't warn in [_any_ context](https://jsfiddle.net/chrisvfritz/72eqv40t/), even though it should probably be considered invalid.  Also, the above code does still guarantee the return of a single vnode (either the first or last element - the 2nd element is seemingly ignored by the parser).
Great job!

why gather the properties from props since there is props passed already? Seems duplicated.
In virtual-dom system of vue 2.0, when we are necessary in order to communicate the parent-child components, need to use the `on`.
I think it's more straightforward to have only `props` as the second argument. We can pass the raw `data` as the 4th argument, since it's going to be rarely used, only for advanced users.
That's sounds good.

","This line needs to check `inBrowser` first otherwise it would throw Error in Node.js.

Also I'd rename it to `hasIndexDB`
Only checking iOS 9.3 may not be future-proof if the same bug remains in 9.4 or future versions of iOS. We may need to do a regex match to check if the version number is greater than 9_3.
In addition: since this check is only used for the specific case of iOS (detecting WKWebView), there is no need to check `webkitIndexedDB` and `mozIndexedDB`.

I prefer moving `module` specialized cases to separated files ( attrs, classes, etc).

All `patch` need to do is to call their hooks at the right time.
A case suit for `patch` is not responsible for their correctness.
Agree with @Twiknight that this file is a bit too big - let's split it into multiple files (similar to how snabbdom's tests are).
Thanks review!
I'll try to split test cases into multiple files.

We are generating a new map every time `optimize` is called. Wondering if there's a way to cache this since most of the time it's going to be the same map.
OK, done.
How about generate a string option `staticKeys` directly in `CompilerOptions` in `web-compiler.js`?
~~actually this option can be a function called `isStaticKey` directly... no need to cache it!~~

~~The problem though is the `genStaticKey` function should not be in an entry file, since other platform's entry file will probably also need it~~

nevermind, saw updated changes
If we do this the basic static keys `'type,tag,attrsList,attrsMap,plain,parent,children,staticAttrs'` also put into the entry file. That's not good from my opinion.

Fixed.
Here it should be `v-for=""item in row.items""`... previous versions were ignoring the columnCount all together. This explains why numbers were off - we should probably just test 1000 x 10 which is a more practical scenario (Note it's 10k components, not just cells)

As mentioned we still need to ignore reactivity, and manually call hooks.
","Isn't `return` here redundant?
Most likely both `return` statements here are not needed.  :)
Unfortunately we don't actually need this. I didn't explain it clear enough, but the proper usage would be bundling the root component via Webpack with `target: 'node'`, which already automatically shims `require.ensure` and `require(['...'], cb)` into synchronous requires. So as long as you stick to Webpack's supported code splitting syntax, you don't need to do anything.
While this fixes the hook invocation order, this is mounting the entire component tree synchronously. I'm wondering if it's possible to delay the mounting to play nicer with streaming mode...
Agreed, would need to be able to initialise the component's without mounting. The question is how?
Resolved: Ensured that synchronous components are able to be resolved.
Directly call `_update` with `_render` result. In some scenarios `_watcher` was not yet defined. This is also faster anyway.
Above could probably be provided by an internal function to reduce duplicated code.

Okay! I'll try to add a test case for that soon.
@posva @yyx990803 
While preparing the test cases, I found some attribute serialization are different than v1.0 output like the following.

| Attr | current v2.0 output | v1.0 output |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| :test=""null"" | attr value: null | attr removed |
| :test=""false"" | attr value: 'false' | attr removed |
| :test=""true"" | attr value: 'true' | attr value: '' |
| :xlink:special=""null"" | attr value: null | attr removed |
| :draggable=""false"" | attr value: 'true' | attr value: 'false' |
| :disabled=""false"" | attr value: 'disabled' | attr removed |

I modified the 2.0 serialization code to be matched with v1.0 output.

Note that current code of `el.data.attrs['server-rendered'] = true` will have blank attribute by applying the spec. I changed this into String `el.data.attrs['server-rendered'] = 'true'`

More detail, please refer the test cases.
@tejitak nice job!
FYI I made some changes in 5fb1a54 to make the behavior more consistent (and different from 1.x):
- Only `null`, `undefined` and `false` are considered to be falsy values in all cases, including for enumerated attributes. This means `:draggable=""''""` will result in `draggable=""true""`.
- For enumerated attributes, in addition to the falsy values above, the string value of `""false""` will also render as `attr=""false""`.

phanan,2676,discussion,Add support for decimal places in currency filter,closed,2016-04-15,"I know @yyx990803 has little intention to extend these core functionality, but IMHO you either support something fully or you don't at all. So‚Ä¶

Currently the ""currency"" filter only accepts one argument: the currency symbol. The number of decimal places is fixed as 2. This can cause troubles with several currencies out there whose number of decimal places can be 0 (e.g. Japanese Yen or Vietnamese Dong) or 3 (e.g. Jordanian Dinar).

This commit modifies the filter to accept an extra optional argument: decimal places, which defaults to 2. With this, one can write `{{ 1234 | currency '¬•' 0 }}` to properly display a Yen value. Backward compatibility is maintained.

(Just realized there's a [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35725935/need-a-flexible-currency-filter-in-vuejs) about this very issue, where the OP was recommended to create a new filter, which is anti-DRY IMO).

Also, decimal places is certainly a currency property and should be implemented as such.
I agree to some extent with your argument,  I suppose this is down to how @yyx990803 sees it best implemented.

I think that this [commit](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/93c1a50b89e1c263f8c324a36d9292a39131c798) will probably be a good reference for that.  üò∫ 
@kazupon so i guess i can remove my test for the warnings... However tests pass fine if not using `_runtimeData`

Seems slightly flawed for recalling data function for warning on dev, as could incur different results in production/development. However, this no longer acts as so in current code, so it's a matter of what `this._runtimeData` achieves.
Hey, I have been asking about this question on various sites trying to find why my `data()` hook is being duplicated... so according to this it's a bug introduced starting at 1.0.18 and the newest commit is fixing? Is `data()` supposed to fire twice? Just checking for my own sanity :)
@dargue3 No, it's not. It should only be fired once üòÑ 
@posva well at least I know I'm not crazy. Interesting how it has taken this long for anyone to notice... Or am I just the only one sending AJAX requests in my `data()` hook?

Like I said, through trial-and-error I found that this bug was introduced in `v1.0.18`
@dargue3 You might not be the only one but you shouldn't do that üòñ 
This may help you http://vuejs.org/guide/components.html#activate-Hook

Thanks for reporting that @dargue3 
This was partially a dirty workaround to allow passing values for props in the `data` option. But now I think it was a bad idea to overload `data` for that purpose.

So now I've introduced a dedicated option `propsData` for passing props at instantiation calls.
I don't understand the purpose of the new `propsData` hook. The `props` can be defined with a default value, and data can be initialized in the `data()` hook right?
@YerkoPalma `props` are resolved async, [as described here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/2397#issuecomment-188925841) and I think `propsData` is sync, so it's ready in child component init. But let's wait until Evan updates docs about new `propsData`, he will make it clear.
@YerkoPalma default values are the same for every instance created. `propsData` is a way to provide different prop values at instance creation time without having to wrap it in a parent instance.

e.g. instead of first registering and rendering a parent instance with:

``` js
<test :data=""123""></test>
```

You can just

``` js
new Test({
  propsData: {
    data: 123
  }
})
```

This is mostly about facilitating easier unit tests for components, not something you'd use very often in application code.
I see. Everything that help on tests is fine :smile: Thanks for the answer.

If there some default type such as ""Array"", ""String"" and check them with internal method would better?

``` js
function checkType(prop, type) {
  return Object.prototype.toString.call(prop) === ('[object ' + type +']');
}

props: {
  prop1: [""Array"", ""Number""]
}
```
Is it possible to support `null` as a possible type? For example, if I want a prop to either be null or a string, I could set the type to `[String, null]`
@saul it doesn't support that.

This change maintains the current behaviour. To achieve that  you can create a custom validator.
@saul as of 1.0.20 I believe `null` and `undefined` no longer raises type check warnings.
","I think this function could be moved to a utilities file for reusability?
Good idea. I'll probably move it to `src/util/component.js` or perhaps `src/util/lang.js`
Let's keep it here for now since it's not yet used in any other context. We can move it when we do need to use it elsewhere.
Can this be simplified to: `types.map(formatType).join(', ')`?

Also, it may make more sense to join with `"" or ""`, so the warning becomes: ""Expected Boolean or String"" instead of ""Expected Boolean, String""
condition could be replaced with `valid === false`
Yeah the code is more readable the way you say. @yyx990803 already did that in this [commit](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/daab3c5f58c97bcb7c528ae199f0419456703e8f). You are right, perhaps using `"" or ""` instead of `"", ""` is a better approach.
I've just noticed that this was also changed with this [merge](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/e831412f2a4fbf89f66c13aab0988976adc8ff72)
They say, `let` should be used instead of `var` in ES6.
By the way, checking the `constructor` or `constructor.name` is not reliable enough?

``` js
let ok = 'test'
ok.constructor === String // true

`value` is not guaranteed to be an Array - it can be an Object too. I think it's better to improve `contains` so that it also checks objects inside arrays.
let's cache `value[i]` in a variable here
returning here is wrong: it should be `if (hasOwn(value[i], key)) { return true }`
same here: should be a conditional return true.

We can also cache `value[i]` here.

Here's what I think what should be the ideal API: the custom directive should just declare `terminal: true` instead of monkey patching the internal `terminalDirectives` array. We should also change `v-if` and `v-for` to use the same `terminal: true` contract.

With this, the `checkTerminalDirectives` function would largely be the same with `compileDirectives` - pseudo code:

```
let A = ""current terminal directive found with highest priority""
- for each attribute on current element:
  - if it's a directive, and has `terminal: true`:
    - if A doesn't exist, or it has higher priority than A:
      - assign it to A
- If A exists, return a terminalLinkFn for it.
```

Does this make sense? I may have overlooked something but I think this could make it more efficient and more consistent.
> custom directive should just declare `terminal: true`

Do want. This will allow to make things like [vue-transfer-dom](https://github.com/rhyzx/vue-transfer-dom) truly reusable (i.e. without `Vue.use(...)`).
I totally agree with the approach not to monkey patch parts of the core API.  This clearly has a use case that makes sense to easily implement, with future extentions this will become ever more requested. 
@yyx990803 
Thank you for your code review , new API proposal for terminal directive, and pseudo code.

When I'm implementing the patch of this PR, I felt that `terminalDirectives` array is monkey patch. I think that your API proposal make sense.

I'll try to challenge based on your feedback. :smile_cat:

@yyx990803 
Updated Done.

This PR is breaking change of custom terminal directives.
We need to write the document terminal directive feature.
@kazupon yes. Custom terminal directives were not publicly documented though, so technically this is a new feature. One case I can think of is https://github.com/rhyzx/vue-transfer-dom may need to be updated to use the new API. /cc @rhyzx 
Merged! :tada: 
I think this is the first PR that makes non-trivial updates to the compiler mechanism, great job @kazupon !
@yyx990803 
Thanks !! 

As next step, I'll try to write the documentation. 
","Perhaps assign the args[0] to a variable.
These change seems pretty expensive since it's now map + sort + nested for loop for every single element compiled. Ideally we want to move as much work out of this function as possible.
we can already extract arg as `matched[2]` here, and can just use that and pass it to `makeTerminalNodeLinkFn` instead of using `argRE`.

Indeed, it breaks caching since the vue instance produced might be different every time.
Would something like 

``` javascript
components: {
  dynamic: function(resolve) {
    require([`${this.path}/dynamic_module`], function(resolvedComp) {
      resolvedComp.isDynamic = true;
      resolve(resolvedComp);

``` javascript
if (!res.options.isDynamic) {
  factory.resolved = res;
}
```

works? This is just the first idea crossing my mind, but it kinda looks like a dirty hack.
Or maybe there's a better way to resolve dynamic components I'm not aware of? 
One thing you can do:

``` js
components: {
  dynamic: function factory (resolve) {
    require([`${this.path}/dynamic_module`], function(resolvedComp) {
      resolve(resolvedComp); // this call sets the cache
      factory.resolved = null; // disable the cache
    }
  }
}
```
Ok, I'll merge this since it seems cache busting can be achieved without other changes.

thecrypticace,2211,,"Support backspace with ""delete"" keycode alias",closed,2016-01-22,"Currently when using the `delete` alias in a on directive with keyup `delete"" does not support using backspace. This seems quite counterintuitive. Additionally, on Mac keyboards the key normally identified as ""backspace"" on PC keyboards is called ""delete."" I was fairly surprised when using the delete modifier didn't detect the key.

I came upon this when developing a search / tag field that turned a search query into tokens when hitting enter or space. I wanted a way to delete tokens without using the mouse. The solution I came up with was detecting the delete key and removing the last token if the search field was empty. I spent 10 minutes debugging code until I realized that I had to press fn+delete (equivalent of DEL / forward delete on a Mac laptop-sized keyboard) for it to actually remove the token.

You can see a reduced test case / demo of this here: http://codepen.io/thecrypticace/pen/YwGKmJ

This PR makes a change to allow aliases to map to multiple key codes. And, using that, it adds support for delete to react to both backspace and DEL / forward delete.

For microtask vs macrotask, see https://jakearchibald.com/2015/tasks-microtasks-queues-and-schedules/
Sorry to bump in a bit offtopic Evan ( @yyx990803 ), but what is a macrotask? The article only mentions tasks and microtasks (and it is a great article btw). 

Scott
@yyx990803 gotcha. So mutation observer, promise belongs to microtask and setImmediate, setTimeout, process.nextTick belongs to (macro)task?

And Q1: mutation observer / promise >> (process.nextTick in Node.js > ) setImmediate > setTimeout(0) / process.nextTick polyfill in Browser. Is that correct?
Q2: why a DOM related solution (mutation observer) not promise? 
Ahh...ok. A regular task is a macrotask. Right?

Scott
Q1: yes except that process.nextTick is also microtask in Node > 0.9

Q2: because MutationObserver is more widely supported than native Promise,
and the user may be using a Promise polyfill that doesn't adhere to the
microtask semantics.

1. Instead of specifying coerce type separately, how about just `coerce: true`? Since the type is declared already. For example:
   
   ``` js
   {
     type: Number,
     coerce: true
   }
   ```
   
   Will simply coerce the value into number.
2. In addition to initialization, the coercion should also happen when prop is updated: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/directives/internal/prop.js#L28-L30
@yyx990803 coerce can be a function.
@yyx990803 Maybe it is better to coerce value in assertProp function.
@lepture yeah, coerce in `assertProp` sounds better.

For the value of the option, `number` and `int` sounds pretty arbitrary for me. How about `boolean` and `string`? It seems the following would be more reasonable:
1. If `coerce` is a function, use that function to coerce the value;
2. In other cases, `coerce` must be used together when `type` is also present, and it will coerce the value to the type specified. (there are internal util functions for these)
3. Special needs like `int` should just use a custom coerce function.
How about coerce accepts only function by now? We could implement other values later.

BTW, Boolean, String, Number are valid functions too.
Actually it should be in initProp
initProp doesn't affect when the prop is updated from the parent though
Yes. But it should be in initProp, since we have to assign the coerced value to vm. I'll parse the value in update bind.
We can extract `coerceProp` as a function into util, so that it can be used in both places like `assertProp` and `initProp`.
@yyx990803 updated. Should I export `coerceProp`?
Yeah, we should export it, and then call it before `assertProp` here: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/directives/internal/prop.js#L28
@yyx990803 updated. It should be documented and tested now.
Cool it passes now, can you add a test case for it?
@yyx990803 updated with tests.
:+1:  Thanks!
Is it possible to access the vue instance inside the coerce function?
I have defined some helper methods I want to use.

```
    someObj: {
      coerce (val) {
        // return this.$helper.copy(val) <-- would be nice
        return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(val))
      }
    },
```
","So if `options.coerce` exists the function does nothing...?
if (! coerce)
should be `coerceProp(prop, val)`
OMG.

Good point. Let's wrap it in `$get`. Also, use `util.toArray` to convert `arguments` to an array, the `...args` syntax adds a long for loop in the compiled code.

With this PR, such use case no longer receives a warning and actually writes the value back to the original array at the wrong index.

Previously objects with properties with get/set defined outside of vue wouldn't propagate value changes after being made reactive in vue. This uses getOwnPropertyDescriptor to detect that case and account for it. 

Since it seems like every browser with supports defineProperty also supports getOwnPropertyDescriptor, I didn't add any logic to detect/work without it. 

Also added are two test cases testing the concept. 

If this addition gets pulled, it'd also probably be worthwhile checking the 'configurable' property. If configurable is set to false, defineReactive currently just throws an error. I imagine the correct behavior would be just to return out without changing anything; but this patch doesn't address it.

I've considered implementing this before, but decided not to because of 2 reasons:
1. As stated, Vue expects your ""data"" to be plain objects so that they can be serialized and re-hydrated. Also, being plain objects make them easy to reason about. Allowing the data to contain arbitrary external getter will make component state less predictable. This is why Vue provides computed properties but intentionally limit them to the view layer. I don't really see any particularly convincing use case for data objects with pre-defined getter/setters. Most of them can be achieved using alternative patterns. 
2. Having to check `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` for every single property actually introduces a roughly 10% performance hit even if the user doesn't use this feature at all. This is the primary reason I did not implement this in Vue in the first place.

So unfortunately, I'll have to decline this - but let me know if you think there's a convincing use case that justifies the performance cost. In general, it's a good idea to discuss new features before submitting a PR. But I really appreciate your effort and please keep contributing in the future!
I'm not sure if the use case I'm targeting it for is going to be particularly compelling, but here is what I was using for it. I'm interfacing it with a C library ported into emscripten; the object properties on the JS side invoke getters and setters exposed from emscripten to set attributes in C; which are eventually used to calculate stuff in the C library.

At a 10% performance hit I completely understand not including it. If that wasn't the case, would you consider inclusion? I was curious about the number because I hadn't tested timing benchmarks at all under the assumption that getOwnPropertyDescriptor should be more or less free if you are only doing it once per defineProperty. Did you see the 10% hit on object creation or on object access? I wrote up some quick benchmarks and didn't see a hit in chrome, node, or firefox, but I only tested the latest versions. 
The 10% number was a brief test using one of the re-render benchmarks: https://github.com/vuejs/js-repaint-perfs The cost mostly comes at when replacing large nested objects and we need to convert these new objects to become reactive. This is probably not the most common use case though, so the overall perf hit would be less obvious.

In fact, it maybe a good idea to include this feature under a flag: it's off by default, but can be turned on when you need it and are ok with the perf tradeoff. For example, `Vue.config.convertAllProperties = true`.
Apologies if the above comments aren't formatted correctly; I've never actually used the in-diff commenting in github. 

This should address the key points; namely putting the functionality behind an option which defaults to off and minimizing impact to normal attributes when the option is turned on. I switched out the getter/setter function approach for one that, for the common case of normal attributes, doesn't have to call any functions which should perform better on some engines. 
Thanks!
No problem! Thanks for reconsidering on the feature inclusion!

I did find a problem with the merged commit. 'property' is undefined when defineReactive is actually adding a field that wasn't there before to obj. I'm sure this happens in other places, but I first saw it in the for directive. I have a commit which tests and addresses this in my fork. It didn't flag in the unit tests since that config option is false by default. 

I reran the unit tests with the flag switched on by default and everything passed, so I think it should be good now. I'll be playing with it more in my project to see how it goes; would you rather I make pull requests if/when each thing comes up or group them up over a few days? 
Thanks for the follow up - note that I've made some modifications to the merged parts (mostly trying to further simplify it): https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/a71aa59364a0218165e582df5877a8a931d3400f

Ideally rebase your fork against the latest dev before submitting the new PR :)
","Two things here:
1. The getter and setter should be invoked using `obj` as the `this` context, so `getter.call(obj)`.
2. The getter only needs to be called once inside the reactive getter. Calling it every time seems unnecessary.
Since people may use Vue in PhantomJS, I've intentionally avoided using the native `bind`. You can use the `bind` provided by Vue's own util: `_.bind(get, obj)` and remove the bind shim in tests.
Since `val` is now a getter, if the original is also a getter, we are still effectively invoking the original getter multiple times here. We should just cache the value as `var value = target.val` at the top of the metaGetter.
Just noticed it's possible for a property to only have getters, or only have setters. We should handle all three possible situations here. Probably need to procedurally build up the descriptor based on the presence of the getter and the setter.
Should be fine to just return `val` here as well.
Please bear with me, thanks for the effort so far :)
No worries it's all good feedback. 

I think the getter/setter stuff makes sense, but might as well also make it safely handle 'configurable' being false. For now I'll make it so it just leaves everything alone; let me know if you think some other behavior makes more sense. 
Not sure how I missed replacing this one out; I'll add a test condition which enforces only calling the underlying getter once.

It's a bit tricky here because the build setup currently uses `grunt-eslint` which depends on eslint `^1.1.0`. So if we update the root eslint to `1.3.1`, npm will install a separate copy of eslint under grunt-eslint.

I will likely update the build setup to get rid of `grunt-eslint` later, but for now let's stay away from altering the build setup to avoid rebase headaches from the alpha/beta branches. Thanks for raising the issue.

fergaldoyle,1129,,v-model radio and checkbox expressions,closed,2015-08-07,"**Radio input**
Added the ability to specify an expression, via attribute `exp`, which will be evaluated on the current scope and set as the v-model value when the radio is selected, similar to Angular `ng-value`. e.g.

``` html
<input type=""radio"" name=""sample"" v-model=""model.radio"" value=""1"" exp=""true"" />
<input type=""radio"" name=""sample"" v-model=""model.radio"" value=""0"" exp=""false"" />
```

If the first radio is selected, `model.radio === true` instead of `""1""`. When the model updates and `exp` is present, we match the evaluated expression rather than the `value` string when choosing which radio to set as `checked`.

**Checkbox input**
Added the ability to specify a `true-value` and `false-value` which will override the default `true`/`false` values. Similar to Angular `ng-true-value` and `ng-false-value`. e.g:

``` html
<input type=""checkbox"" v-model=""model.checkbox1"" true-value=""'someTrueValue'"" false-value=""'someFalseValue'""/>
<input type=""checkbox"" v-model=""model.checkbox2"" true-value=""expression1"" false-value=""expression2""/>
```

If present `true-value` and `false-value` will be evaluated on the current scope, and set as the v-model value when the checkbox changes. Similar to the radio, if the model changes a comparison is made against `true-value` and `false-value` values to determine the checkbox state.

Cool! Mind rebasing against latest `dev` so the CI build can pass?
Hitting the limits of my git knowledge here, I've re-based `v-model-enhancments` onto `dev`, will I have to open a new pull request?

https://github.com/fergaldoyle/vue/commits/dev

```
git checkout dev
git pull https://github.com/yyx990803/vue.git dev
git checkout v-model-enchancements
git rebase dev
git push -f
```
That seemed to work
Thanks!
","Since `el.checked` can be only `true` or `false`, we just need to check if `value` equals `trueValue` here - in all other cases we just return false. This could make `matchValue` much simpler.
To be consistent with `exp` for radio input, maybe we should use `true-exp` and `false-exp`?

Hmm, in suggestion, OP needs ability to filter number through currency filter _without appending symbol_. How would `currency = currency != null ? currency : '$'` do that? 
so that he can do `money | currency ''`. Currently empty string is considered falsy and gets casted into `$`.
well, as I said in PR description, `''` is casted to `undefined` :) Is this bug somewhere in parser?  

Otherwise I was going to use empty string as a _no-symbol param_ also. Only ""ok"" choice was to take `false` as _no-symbol param_. Another choice is to remove this slightly discriminating `$` default :smile: , but that would be breaking change.

In IE, nextSibling returns a text node, but text node has no method 'contains'.
Merging so you can get credit, I'll fix with tests. :) thanks
FYI, we had the same issue, and came to the same workaround in testing (+cur.contains(el) on the if directive), but kept digging, and it was triggered by IE9 when doing v-if inside a < template > tag.
yep, the whole IE family doesn't implement `contains` for text nodes. In the [spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/domcore/#node) `contains` is part of the `Node` interface, which should be available for text nodes as well, but oh well, it's IE...
","Thanks for the fix! The situation can be a bit more complicated though, in the case where the component is a block instance (thus its `$el` can be a TextNode too).

So I think it's better to change the check to:

``` js
if (
  cur === c.$el || // both are textNodes
  (cur.contains && cur.contains(c.$el)) // other situations
) {
  return true
}
```
we still need to check the case where `cur === c.$el`, because in IE `cur.contains` is not present if `cur` is a textNode

","One possible issue here: if all nodes in `selected` are nested ones (thus should be filtered out), we end up outputting empty content, but in that case we should actually use the fallback content (`outlet.childNodes`).

According to http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/#dfn-pool-distribution-algorithm, the algorithm here should be:
- For each direct child node of `raw`, check if it matches `select`.
- If yes, push it into `selected`.
- If `selected` ends up empty, use `outlet.childNodes` instead.

This also means we need a `matches()` helper in `util/dom.js`:

``` js
var p = Element.prototype
var matches = p.matches || p.webkitMatchesSelector || p.mozMatchesSelector || p.msMatchesSelector
exports.matches = function (el, selector) {
  return matches.call(el, selector)
}
```
I wanted to avoid element.matches because its browser support is slightly worse than querySelectorAll (http://caniuse.com/#feat=matchesselector vs http://caniuse.com/#search=queryselectorall). In practice it probably doesn't matter (opera mini 8 is the only browser that's still used of those, and I don't know if vue even supports it), but I decided to play it safe.

That's interesting question. Here is my thoughts:
It seems that printing an empty string is a default way to say that value is wrong. Currency filter does it for `undefined` and for `NaN`. And it would be less weird to see 'Amount: ' than 'Amount: NaN' or 'Amount: Infinity' somewhere in interface.

Also I made this test with AngularJS, it prints empty string: http://jsfiddle.net/41Lga6bg/

Thanks. I really like the ideas behind Vue, so I hope I can contribute more in the future. : ) I'm rather interested in this https://github.com/yyx990803/vue/issues/604

BTW, it there a dev version of the documentation? I cannot see that in https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org 
Greatly appreciated, I'm actually thinking about #604 just now, although I don't have a very clear vision for it yet.

There's no `dev` version for the doc site, I usually just quickly do a bunch of commits on master before a new release. (I've already documented about this `v-style` change btw)

","Why slice then unshift here? It seems simply `plugin.install.apply(plugin, arguments)` will do.
Because I want to replace `arguments[0]` with `ViewModel` (otherwise, `arguments[0]` is the plugin function / string / object), and `arguments[0]` cannot be reassigned.
Oh you're right, I was reading the code out of context...
Can you use `[].slice` here? This function is not perf sensitive and it could save a few bytes :)
I think it's better to keep `this` context consistent here. In the case of a raw function could you use `plugin.apply(null, args)`?
Sure! I was using Array.prototype.slice for performance reasons, but you are right :)
One more note - let's check `if (plugin.install)` first. This way plugins can also expose functions that has a `install` method.
Agree, I will do that. Do you prefer a separate commit, or should I try to force an amended version?
Force push with one commit please. I'd love to keep the commit log as clean as possible. Thanks a lot!
I don‚Äôt do any check here, I think it‚Äôs fine to crash if a plugin author tries to `.use()` a plugin with a wrong interface.
Can you remove the `vue` argument here and in the function below? Just for jshint to pass (complaining unused vue...). I've run through the build and everything else looks good to merge once this is fixed.
Done!

- [x] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)

**Other information:**

The convincing reason was explained at length over at #8106. I know this will not be merged, in fact I'm gonna close it myself. But I'm publishing this PR for reference for anyone else interested.

The initial need was for components, but when reviewing the code I thought the most elegant way to do this was by changing the `resolveAsset()` function to call a user function defined on the `$options` object:

```
getComponent(id: string, identifierSpellings: Object): void | Component | AsyncComponent
getDirective(id: string, identifierSpellings: Object): void | Directive
getFilter(id: string, identifiesSpellings: Object): void | Filter
```

The `identifierSpellings` object has normalized spellings in case the user needs it:

- raw: the way it was called
- hyphenated
- camelized
- PascalCase
- and a toString() method, which returns the raw version

The nice thing about this is that it gives all the power to the user, and enables him to do many things which aren't possible with the current api, and the biggest use case is to **lazily load async components only when they are needed.**

I know that to submit a decent PR, I'd still need to write tests and documentation... that is the next step.

Fixes #8798 

When you refer to `$refs`, the type if always something truthy, while it is possible that the value is `undefined`.
Without this change, one can refer to a `ref` that is `undefined`, but TypeScript thinks it is `Element` or `Vue`.

This PR added `undefined` type to the type of `$refs`. This way it is more type-safe when using `$refs`.

It won't make any change when users don't turn on `strictNullChecks`. And if users do turn on it, this pull request doesn't prevent them from casting refs to non-null.  To sum, the benefit of adding `undefined` doesn't pay for its cost.

The logic is still needed to coerce `true` and `false` to `""true""` and `""false""` - we just need to allow additional values.Then maybe we should coerce all boolean bindings for non-boolean attributes to string. There are other attributes like `aria-hidden` which accept `'true'`/`'false'` values. Now it seems that we already require users to coerce themselves. Is it better to apply this default coercing to all non-boolean attributes? There seems no need to have special logic for enumerated attributes - we only have normal attributes and boolean ones. @yyx990803Hmm that's true... however, dropping the logic altogether would technically be a breaking change, as code that previous produced valid usage would now require manual coercing from the user.

So I think for 2.x it's better to just loosen the coercing to skip non-boolean values so that other values for `contenteditable` can be used.Current behavior for normal attributes and ‚Äúenumerated attributes‚Äù in Vue:

| Binding | `foo` | `draggable` |
| - | - | - |
| `:attr=""null""` | / | `draggable=""false""` |
| `:attr=""undefined""` | / | / |
| `:attr=""true""` | `foo=""true""` | `draggable=""true""` |
| `:attr=""false""` | / | `draggable=""false""` |
| `:attr=""0""` | `foo=""0""` | `draggable=""true""` |
| `attr=""""` | `foo=""""` | `draggable=""true""` |
| `attr=""foo""` | `foo=""foo""` | `draggable=""true""` |
| `attr` | `foo=""""` | `draggable=""true""` |

I can think of two solutions:

1. We can coerce boolean values into string and drop `enumeratedAttrs` entirely, we'll have:

    | Binding | new `draggable` | old `draggable` |
    | - | - | - |
    | `:draggable=""null""` | / | `draggable=""false""` |
    | `:draggable=""undefined""` | / | / |
    | `:draggable=""true""` | `draggable=""true""` | `draggable=""true""` |
    | `:draggable=""false""` | `draggable=""false""` | `draggable=""false""` |
    | `:draggable=""0""` | `draggable=""0""` | `draggable=""true""` |
    | `draggable=""""` | `draggable=""""` | `draggable=""true""` |
    | `draggable=""foo""` | `draggable=""foo""` | `draggable=""true""` |
    | `draggable` | `draggable=""""` | `draggable=""true""` |

    It brings a lot of consistency across all enumerated properties and the only cases which will break legacy usage would be we are not coercing `null` to `'false'` and invalid stuff (numbers, empty strings, attributes without values) to `'true'` anymore. Or we can still coerce attributes without binding value to `'true'` to make some usage still work (`foo` &rarr; `foo=""true""` doesn't hurt).

2. Or we can keep the `enumertedAttrs` logic, and directly output the original value as long as we got string, we'll have:

    | Binding | new `draggable` | old `draggable` |
    | - | - | - |
    | `:draggable=""null""` | `draggable=""false""` | `draggable=""false""` |
    | `:draggable=""undefined""` | / | / |
    | `:draggable=""true""` | `draggable=""true""` | `draggable=""true""` |
    | `:draggable=""false""` | `draggable=""false""` | `draggable=""false""` |
    | `:draggable=""0""` | `draggable=""true""` | `draggable=""true""` |
    | `draggable=""""` | `draggable=""""` | `draggable=""true""` |
    | `draggable=""foo""` | `draggable=""foo""` | `draggable=""true""` |
    | `draggable` | `draggable=""true""` | `draggable=""true""` |

    The second might be safer but my concern is that the original `enumeratedAttrs` is actually flawed. Otherthan `spellcheck`/`draggable`/`contenteditable`, there are quite a few enumerated (and boolean-like) attributes in WAI-ARIA like `aria-hidden`/`aria-selected`/... so there's already inconsistency here. The first plan would solve this inconsistency.",

The `newDepIds` property of each Watcher instance object holds all the dependencies collected by this evaluation. We can prevent the `dependArray` function from being called multiple times by checking if the dependency has been collected.
",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8734,"['src/core/observer/index.js', 'src/core/observer/watcher.js', 'test/unit/modules/observer/observer.spec.js']",,,"em.. I think the changes in this PR cause a regression bug.

It looks like the `dependArray` method was designed to solve the dependency problem in a nested array.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <p>{{ nest[0] }}</p>
    <button @click=""nest[0].push('next')"">add one</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      nest: [
        ['init'],
      ],
    };
  },
}
</script>
```

Have not try this example with your branch yet, but I think the `checkRelated` will cause the nest array not reactive.The `dependArray` function will still execute, except that it will only execute `once`.
`Watcher` collects dependencies by executing getters, and each time the getter is executed, the `watcher.cleanupDeps` function is executed to reset `newDepIds`. That is, everything is a new start every time the watcher's getter is re-executed, but in the process, there is no need to execute the `dependArray` function multiple times. It does not cause nested arrays to be not reactive.my bad, the check was executed before depend so it is ok:)@wangyi7099 
When value is a plain-object, your code will cause it to fail to collect dependencies. And performance issues only occur in the case of large arrays, usually we don't need to care about objects@HcySunYang 
I'm sorry. My sample code has some errors. I  have updated it.

>  And performance issues only occur in the case of large arrays, usually we don't need to care about objects

I think you are right. But I also think care about plain-object will also save some performance cost.",

`parseComponent('...', { pad: 'space' }).script.content` will contain code with base indent if SFC content has base indent. Also applies to styles or etc.

As #5058 and #5059, `pad: 'space'` is for character-oriented tools that calculate positions by distance from the beginning of the file instead of by line. This should be applied to source code itself, so I think it was buggy and breaking change is unavoidable.

Currently for older browsers (IE9~IE11) we cannot use `v-html` on SVG elements because they don't support `innerHTML` for SVG elements. While actually we can fix this without much effort and make it ‚Äújust works‚Äù. As `innerHTML` is defined for `Element` interface (which `SVGElement` is derived from) [in the latest spec](https://w3c.github.io/DOM-Parsing/#dfn-innerhtml), I think it's reasonable to add this for `v-html`.

**Other information:**

Related issues: #5310 #5756

Since it's a browser-specific fix and we don't run tests for IE locally, I created a repo to demonstrate the fix: https://github.com/Justineo/v-html-svg

* With latest `vue` on `unpkg.com`, see: https://justineo.github.io/v-html-svg/test-original.html
* After the fix, see: https://justineo.github.io/v-html-svg/test-fixed.html

I've tested and it should now work in IE 9~IE 11.

Currently, when transforming `data.model` in `createElement` function, it does not check if the component is a functional component, causing a double update on `v-model`. This prevents double update on v-model in functional components by not transforming model when `Ctor.options.functional` is `true`.

The current type definition for `ComponentOptions` does not have a definition for [async component factories](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html) and as such causes errors when using the syntax with [vue-class-component](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component).",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8438,['types/options.d.ts'],,,":+1:  need this. quite annoying I can't use async component with `vue-class-component` .

```typescript
@Component({
  components: {
    HelloComponent
  }
})
```

this works..
BUT


```typescript
@Component({
  components: {
    'dynamic-component': () => ({
      component : import( 'from/some/index.vue' ),
      loading : LoadingComponent    
    })
  }
})
```

this currently throws a type error. Does this PR fix this? :D :D :D :Dto make it work i had to do

```typescript
@Component<any>({ // <-- this
  components: {
    'dynamic-component': () => ({
      component : import( 'from/some/index.vue' ),
      loading : LoadingComponent    
    })
  }
})
```
:/@FeliciousX yes, this should fix this.","This overload isnt sufficient. At least `createElement` needs overloads too.

I think it would be better to extend the `AsyncComponent` type directly:
```ts
export type AsyncComponent<Data=DefaultData<never>, Methods=DefaultMethods<never>, Computed=DefaultComputed, Props=DefaultProps>
  = AsyncComponentPromise<Data, Methods, Computed, Props>
  | AsyncComponentFactory<Data, Methods, Computed, Props>

export type AsyncComponentPromise<Data=DefaultData<never>, Methods=DefaultMethods<never>, Computed=DefaultComputed, Props=DefaultProps> = (
  resolve: (component: Component<Data, Methods, Computed, Props>) => void,
  reject: (reason?: any) => void
) => Promise<Component | EsModuleComponent> | void;

export type AsyncComponentFactory<Data=DefaultData<never>, Methods=DefaultMethods<never>, Computed=DefaultComputed, Props=DefaultProps> = () => {
  component: AsyncComponentPromise<Data, Methods, Computed, Props>;
  loading?: Component | EsModuleComponent;
  error?: Component | EsModuleComponent;
  delay?: number;
  timeout?: number;
}

sodatea,8422,,"fix(transition): check existence of `el.parentNode`, fix #8199",open,2018-06-27,"Fix #8199 
If the new parentNode gets a `textContent` or `innerHTML` property during patching, the `transition` node would have been detached early, which means `el.parentNode` no longer exists.
So this existential check is necessary.

This is an imperfect fix because while errors are suppressed, transition animations still get lost.
It is due to the different mechanism of `v-html` and VDOM element patching. But fixing that would be much more complex and I don't think we'd bother fixing such an edge case.

I have working code and tests for this here: <https://github.com/coldino/vue/commits/event-handler-errors>. It would need very minor updates to work with the changes in this PR.

This will also address #6953.@coldino 
I think it will be great to address 2 issues in this PR. But what will be the proper way to merge changes? You can create pull request to this branch - ""feature/async-errors-handling"", and I will edit PR according to the changes from you ( for #6953 ).
P.S. or just create separate PR for #6953@enkot The changes will overlap significantly as I would switch to using your handlePromiseError function, so I will create a PR for your branch. Note that in addition to the ones you implemented, I also added async error handling for:
 * watcher callbacks
 * nextTick callbacks
 * invoked functions (v-on)
 * directive hooks

Currently there are only tests for the v-on invoked function async+sync errors. I don't have enough experience with the testing system to add tests for all of them. If you are able to assist with this we can have much greater coverage for async error catching.

I will keep the hooks without tests in a separate commit so you can include/exclude as you choose.I have only included the v-on checks in the PR as I didn't want to include changes with no tests and possibly delay this PR.",

If in your list you have transitions on the nested elements, they will trigger the transitionend events that will cause finishing of transition-group's transition.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8374,['src/platforms/web/runtime/components/transition-group.js'],,,"Could you provide a minimal repro of the bug please?@posva 
Sure: [codesandbox repro](https://codesandbox.io/s/9yq45q0wk4)

p.s.
Of course, in our app code we can subscribe on child's events and use `stopPropagation` as a workaround. But I think, `<transition-group>` should only affect direct descendants
Or at least this case can be documented somewhereThanks, now it is much clearer! This seems reasonable to me but could break some people work, so it would be interesting if there is any reasonable usage of nested elements transitions to trigger that transition-group. This is because, as you said, it's very easy to workaround the problem by adding ` @transitionend.stop` to the nested element that also has a transition",

We are running a dev-setup where all our code is converted to amd module and then concatenated to one file. This is the approach that [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) takes for js dev. For more details see: https://github.com/alexeagle/angular-bazel-example/wiki/Running-a-devserver-under-Bazel When depending on the vue build the problem is it does not have an id so when the umd file is being loaded requirejs complains about an anonymous module. Just by providing the id this is fixed and we can depend on vue from our application.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8371,['scripts/config.js'],,,"I don't think it's a good idea to add an AMD id for the UMD bundle. AMD's named modules is used to handle situations where there are multiple modules inside one single file as an escape hatch. Usually it's for final bundled AMD modules and will make the module less portable. Moreover, adding a module id will be a breaking change which we won't accept ATM.

In your case I suggest you ‚Äúalias‚Äù `vue` to Vue's CommonJS version (`dist/vue.common.js`) and wrap it into a named AMD module during your loading process yourself.Angular for example provides amd ids and it seems to work fine there. I see that in theory it makes it less portable, but how else would one want to call vue? I would be surprised if anyone would not have `import Vue from 'vue'` or the equivalent depending on their module format. But if there is sentiment against it that is also fair enough and this can be closed.",

when I write my vue plugin,I use custom properties in the options.But when I want to support different kind of option,for example ,both array and object,just like the props option, I found  I have to write the normalize code in the mergeStrategy code, expecially considering of mixin condition.It seems wired and not good for reuse other merge strategy .What I do is to support extract the normalize code from merge code.

Currently it's difficult to use the functional template since you lose access to closures where as the render method can reference closed-over functions.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8287,"['src/core/vdom/create-functional-component.js', 'test/unit/features/options/functional.spec.js']",,,"why `functional` component need method?@Kingwl I already explained in the PR body but, when using a render method instead of using a functional template, I can write functions outside of the component and reference them via closure. However, when using a template, I no longer have access to the closure.

I can reference them via `$options.methods` but seems hacky and would prefer official support in offering a similar API to stateful components.I respect your work, but I think there will be a better solution(maybe)
/ cc: @posva I think that rather than having just methods, it will be useful to be able to inject stuff in the context so it can also be accessed in templates What are you thinking @Kingwl ?

@posva If I've understood your suggestion correctly, that is what this PR is doing; it allows methods to be injected into the context so it can be accessed in the template. I'd like to see more support of functional components so that they can be easier to use and hence more useful; this will be a step towards that.

mpbarlow,8250,,fix(#7913): Prevent erroneous warning when using <slot> inside slot-scope,open,2018-05-26,"Because slotNodes inside a slot-scope context are already set to \_rendered = true after initial
render, the warning for duplicate slot presence always fires when a slot-scope prop change triggers
a re-render. With this change, the compiler tracks whether any slot-scoped elements have been
encountered yet at the point the slot is compiled. If so, the direct ancestors of the slot are checked
for slot-scope presence, and if one is found, the warning is supressed.

This is admittedly not a perfect solution, as within a slot-scope context the warning now does not fire even when there _are_ duplicate slots, but I couldn't find a good way to get around that.

**Description:**

Hi, 
When interpolating an object, it uses the JSON.stringify method instead of toString, which is normally the proper method to set a way to convert an object to a string. 
This PR allow you to use your custom `toString` method to render your object if it exists. It's tested (I've also added a test for toJson), and it should not be a breaking change.

Thanks you for your amazing work folks, and see you in Paris next month!",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8217,"['src/shared/util.js', 'test/unit/features/directives/html.spec.js', 'test/unit/features/directives/text.spec.js']",,,"I'm adding some example of the problem to make me understood better:

[![Edit Vue Template](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/0plonqx6jp)

@posva:

I can confirm that your (so used!) `Object.create(null)` example works exactly the same than before (like arrays), as it's not a ""plain object"" (`_toString(Object.create(null))` gives `[object Undefined]`).

And to write here what I told you yesterday, it _could_ be a BC for those who had a object with a `toString` method implemented and still want to use the `toJson`  in templates. I think we can easily consider that this is not a standard case. üòÖ

See you! üëã","I think this function can really use early returns now.As you want, I kept the original style to make as few changes as possible and let the diff easier to read, but it'll be easy to refactor."

Let me check againI added that as well but I wonder if it is correct. I'm not sure what _babel helpers_ are we talking about in 8e1478e3Why not proxying both? I changed all mixins in a big project to respect this rule on Style Guide (https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Private-property-names-essential) and now when I am trying to pass it to a component prop it gets there undefined because it is not being proxiedto prevent conflicts. We cannot check all existing properties (which would be ideal), for conflicts, so we test that instead.
Nowadays, if you want to create plugins that inject custom properties, using Symbols is probably the safest wayYet the style guide recommends it, I think this issue should be given some thought, either change the rule for private property names or proxy everything, (maybe giving a warning in development process). Not proxying this is removing functionality and forcing developers that follow the recommended style guide find workarounds because of limited functionality to prevent others who may not read the documentation and override vue properties.Does it have to be some property starting with preserved prefixes here? It feels a little weird to me that after these checks we concluded that the property starts with `_` or `$`.Something like `warnPreservedPrefix`?if the key is in `$data` it is not proxified, then it can only be starting with those 2 characters. That's what I was thinkingProxying properties starting with $_ would be an optionThese two expects are identical, is that accidental?"

I assumed that since vue was preliminary a Javascript project, it wouldn't have the typescript toolchain installed, and therefore wouldn't be able to test the types.  I'll add a test for this to `yarn test:types`.@ktsn  @LinusBorg Is this a public API ? I checked the doc here https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#render and here https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#render. But it seems nowhere mentions multiple root.The most official source I've seen on the topic has been a core team member here suggesting it as an option at https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7088#issuecomment-345855657

Given that articles like https://zendev.com/2018/05/07/multi-root-vue-components.html are starting to pop up, it probably ought to be added to https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html#Functional-Components.  I'm surprised it wasn't already.@HerringtonDarkholme It's definitely official API. It's one of the reasons functional components were created in the first place.

Adds support for iterable object implementing [Symbol.iterator]()
It shouldn't have an impact for existing code because non iterable objects are not impacted.
Vue will have the same behaviour than a for...of expression for iterables. (actual interest for using iterables)
Allows us to pass an iterable directly to a template without giving internal properties or converting it to an array


I wrote 4 new tests. No existing tests needed changes.
All tests passed. I ran tests with PhantomJS (lack of Symbol support), Firefox and Chrome.

I'm aware of this but I think if you choose to implement [Symbol.iterator] you choose to break old browsers compatibility. This way your iterable object has the same behaviour in Vue than in other parts of your code.
What do you think ?

Tearing down a big set of Vue elements (table rows) with lot of reactive dependencies, was very slow due to array [traversing](https://forum.vuejs.org/t/destroying-a-component-with-many-children/23533). Using an object sped up the whole process. Page 170 rows from 8s to 1sec and 800rows with less reactive data from 6sec to 2.5~sec. This could be observed best while navigating between routes.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8157,"['src/core/observer/dep.js', 'src/core/observer/watcher.js', 'test/unit/modules/observer/dep.spec.js']",,,"Thanks for your PR üëç. You also need to update the related test cases. @defcc Thanks for the heads up, just fixed them.Please provide benchmarks showing actual improvements caused by this change. We can't merge changes to internals without data.@yyx990803 Here are the tests and honestly I'm surprised.

https://jsperf.com/vue-subs-array-vs-object-population
https://jsperf.com/vue-subs-array-vs-object-remove/1

The deletes are ofc way faster (almost 100%, might be even faster in real word) however additions are slow (71% on my machine). Nevertheless in our app additions slowdown is barely noticeable, deletions on the other hand are very noticeable while navigating between routes (i guess because of clearing the deps?) causing one hell of a jank.@DavidReinberger I updated  the test:
https://jsperf.com/vue-subs-array-vs-object-population/6

Replaced {} by Object.create(null).

Shows Object.create(null) performs a little better.
Trying to find a different way, because the object additions are slow, but can't come up with anything viable. Any ideas?So I came up with something like this to get the best from both worlds. During my performance testings I came up with an interesting fact arrays with more than 1024 members were slower.

```javascript
var Dep = function Dep() {
  this.id = uid++;
  this.subs = [];
  this.usesObject = false;
};

Dep.prototype.addSub = function addSub(sub) {
  if (!this.usesObject && this.subs.length > 1024) {
    this.convertToObject();
    this.usesObject = true;
  }

  this.usesObject ? this.subsObj[sub.id] = sub : this.subs.push(sub);
};

Dep.prototype.removeSub = function removeSub(sub) {
  this.usesObject ? (delete this.subsObj[sub.id]) : remove(this.subs, sub);
};

Dep.prototype.convertToObject = function () {
  this.subsObj = Object.create(null);
  this.subsObj = this.subs.reduce(function (deps, dep) {
    deps[dep.id] = dep;
    return deps;
  }, {});
  this.subs = [];
};

Dep.prototype.depend = function depend() {
  if (Dep.target) {
    Dep.target.addDep(this);
  }
};

Dep.prototype.notify = function notify() {
  // stabilize the subscriber list first
  var subs = this.usesObject ? Object.values(this.subsObj) : this.subs.slice();
  for (var i = 0, l = subs.length; i < l; i++) {
    subs[i].update();
  }
};
```maybe something like this (not tested so might be buggy :) ). 
Also not sure what happens if toRemoveSubs.lenght == subs.length (in terms of performance)
```
DepArray.prototype.removeSub = function(toRemoveSubs) {
    this.subs = this.subs.filter(o => toRemoveSubs.indexOf(o) > -1);
};
```

and 

```
var toRemove = [];
removeMembers.forEach(function(member){
    toRemove.push({id: member});
})
arrayDep.removeSub(toRemove)
````
@DavidReinberger interesting find - is it possible to provide benchmarks comparing this strategy vs. Vue's current implementation, for both sub counts below and above 1024?@DavidReinberger but that's seems kinda messy for try to having both, also should considering the convertToObject Or convertBackToArray's consumption, not even mentioned the memory usage, etc...
I don't think it's worthy In a real world.
Also, should consider that benchmark could have different results on various browsers. In latest Edge,  it's not that much gap on object additions. And usually we won't have such large dependency, the cost is negligible, but gain much more on deletions.
Anyway it's better to keep it neat, just take it as a trade-off. Depend on your discovery, so far we may can say in most most cases, the map-key is a better choice.@dsonet converting back to an array is really not a good idea because that would happen every time a count drops below a certain threshold, which happens while leaving a page, therefore the object gets converted back and ruin the performance.

@yyx990803 I'm not really sure what would be the best way to approach this test, since my problem happens only in dependency hungry components (synth. test would take considerable time to setup). As far as I could tell from todays observations (only by ""feel""), the object only implementation is still superior to the hybrid.

EDIT: Just kinda remembered that the hybrid approach did not worked correctly. TBH dunno why, did not have time to investigate.I've also done some further test.

http://jsben.ch/B3IPo
http://jsben.ch/K8fmSJust had a little idea.
AFAIK the biggest implication to tearing down Dep subs is when you are navigating between routes or filtering lists of data, splicing huge arrays of objects is pricy and can jank the browser pretty good.

A more practial approach could be:

1. Mark the watcher (or dep?) as *scheduled for teardown*
2. Deny all notification calls from inside the dep
3. Check how big the subs array is

Smaller arrays could be tore down immediately, big ones could wait with `requestIdleCallback` or use a web worker (which are supported with IE8+)

This could also introduce some kind of watcher ""caching"" or reusability.@yyx990803 @DavidReinberger

Any progress on this? Our service also suffers from the slowness of the `removeSub()` method. I suppose every other large Vue.js apps also be affected significantly by the issue.

FYI: Chrome v66 (the latest official release) has `Array.prototype.splice()` performance regression. The bug makes current `removeSub()` method so inefficient.

Thanks.@h6ah4i Thanks for the info on chrome, never tried to compare perfs across browsers. It seems that safari is way faster!

@yyx990803 I could whip some kind of a detection for chrome and switch the implementation based on the browser, which should give chrome the performance needed.Actually, I just realized a potential problem here when using an Object because the key iteration order is not guaranteed. This may result in different sub notification order in different environments. I will need to spend some more time investigating this as part of 2.6 so please hold on for a bit longer.@yyx990803 Never thought that could be an issue, but totally understandable. Nevertheless is there a timeline when 2.6 is goin to hit beta so we could give it a test?","this line will be costly on an object with many keys. Probably better to just use a `for...in`.Since I've gone down the rabbit hole of performance testing, here are some iteration tests.
http://jsben.ch/3s22e - and the winner is `Object.keys()` with a negative while loop, faster by 7% to a `keys -> map -> loop` solution.Funny thing though, using object literal instead of `Object.create(null)` makes the values -> forEach version faster almost by 200ms ü§î @yyx990803 Any more thoughts on this? So I could go ahead and refactor the iteration and finish it up."

hi
I encountered the same problem(#7138) during development.
In my case, it occurred in the input tag, not the textarea, so I added conditional statements.
after adding the conditional statement, I confirmed that the problem was also resolved in the input tag.

> I'm trying to add a test for this, but struggling a bit.

Could you provide more information on where you struggled? For example, are you not sure where the test should go, or did running the tests not work, etc?@chrisvfritz I placed the test in `test/unit/modules/observer/observer.spec.js`.

The test fails with the generic message `FAILED Observer Cannot enable reactivity on a property that is already defined`

So then I ran the tests against Chrome with inspector to see what is happening; the warning is getting hit in test the same as in dev, but yet it fails in my test (which I also linked in the codepen above).

I could also push my changes onto this pull request, but I didn't necessarily want to do that when I know the test isn't working yet.@bigtunacan You may have to wrap your expectation with `waitForUpdate` (like in [this test](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/test/unit/modules/observer/observer.spec.js#L307-L311)).@chrisvfritz I tried that as well, with the same results.

https://codepen.io/bigtunacan/pen/RyxbLa?editors=0010#Can you upload the exact code you're trying? It's OK if the test is failing - we'll squash when we merge anyway.@chrisvfritz Ok; I've updated the PR@posva I believe this should be ready to merge now.@posva Just curious since it's been sitting for awhile and shows as ""Changes requested"".  Are you still waiting on anything from me to merge this in?  I thought everything was good now?","I think this should be `then` rather than `end`.I've tried that as well, but the result is the same.A Vue instance must have a template prop or render fn, your test is throwing an error before getting to the checks@dhensche Thanks; that was it."

**Other information:**
When we run our test suite with relatively new ( >beta13 ) on vue-test-utils we end up with this issue failing a portion of our test suite as it appears somehow that `componentInstance` is undefined by the time this hook gets called.

I spent about an hour trying to find where to put a test where the destroy hook gets called, but couldn't figure out how to test it properly.  I even attempted to find a good spot by having that function `throw`, but even that wasn't very helpful, so I'd love some help with that.

I'm also happy to help with code there, or whatever, but I could use some guidance since there is a lot of complexity going on around this area of the code, the stack trace we got was:

",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8128,['src/core/vdom/create-component.js'],,,"Did you make sure it also fails without vue test utils?Good point, no it doesn't if I just do the `$mount` myself. So it sounds like something is going on over there with the VNode lifecycle too, but the fix here seems relevant as well, since it seems harmless to null check before operating on the object. Of course unless it was left out explicitly so that this sort of thing would happen to help track down other bugs lolI think you should share the test that caused the error (a boiled down version is better üòÑ ). pinging @eddyerburgh just in case but I will also look at itI thought you might want that, here is the most boiled down version I have that still fails:
```
<template>
  <div class=""tasks__task-container col-sm-6"">
    <transition name=""fade"" mode=""out-in"">
      <div v-if=""!isEditing"" key=""editing"">
      </div>
      <task-form
        v-else
        key=""editing""
        ></task-form>
    </transition>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
import TaskForm from './task-form.vue'

export default {
  components: { TaskForm, },
  props: {
    task: {
      type: Object,
      default: () => {},
    },

    isParticipant: Boolean,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      isCreating: false,
      isEditing: false,
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

and the spec (using jest if that helps):
```
import { shallow } from '@vue/test-utils'
import Vue from 'vue'

import TaskItem from './task-item.vue'

describe('Test suite for Task Item', () => {
  let wrapper
  let vm

I have added that into this PR as per you said`this` type annotation is intentionally omitted because it will be inferred by `ThisType`. `beforeCreate` has it because it does not have user defined date / methods at that moment. @ktsn why does #8096 fail then ? It should fail because you cannot use methods in `beforeCreate`.
https://jsfiddle.net/uxbcb0q7/Okay I understand now. Thanks @ktsn ",

Do you know if there was a specific reason why the previous code chose to use inheritance as a way of merging objects instead of overwriting one object layer?I think that's one of the functions of tests, and since nothing is breaking as we can see from CI, I don't think it matters much. Unless truly, there's a weird reason for doing it the way they did. I'll be happy to know your other thoughts
@hirokiosame What's the difference?@kayandrae07 
Yeah it might be ok. Just wanted to highlight it for whoever's reviewing it -- I speculate there's a good reason for using inheritance as a form of merging when most places use assignment.

@lusarz 
The difference is significant in the case of `Object.create(null)`; this creates an object that inherits `null`, so there are no Object prototype methods accessible. (eg. `({}).hasOwnProperty` exists but `Object.create(null).hasOwnProperty` doesn't)

I personally use this when I want to create a clean hash-map where my keys won't collide with any of the Object prototype methods. Basically, the same reason why someone would use `Map` over an Object. In this case, hypothetically, if someone were to lookup properties `constructor`, `toString`, etc. in this object, it would be truthy.

",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8066,"['src/core/global-api/use.js', 'src/core/instance/events.js', 'src/shared/util.js']",,,"Since at the moment we transpile vue to ES5.1 for IE support - that does not bring any benefit and actually decreases performance:
```js
  for (var _len = arguments.length, b = Array(_len > 1 ? _len - 1 : 0), _key = 1; _key < _len; _key++) {
    b[_key - 1] = arguments[_key];

```I think main benefit of these changes is related with code quality. If it is possible to write something with less amount of code, why don't do it ?

I see also a few places in `vue` code where spread operator like `...args` is used, so it would be nice to be consistent:

Sometimes I'd rather think more about performance when developing a framework. And using `Array.prototype.slice.call(list, start)` may bring performance benefit depending on array usage (more info [here](https://v8project.blogspot.ro/2017/09/elements-kinds-in-v8.html)).

",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8039,['types/vue.d.ts'],,,"Hi @yringler , thanks for your contribution.

However, Vue's typing file only exposes public API. The `option` is not public nor is documented on https://vuejs.org/v2/api/.

If you want to use this private API anyway, you can try interface augmentation. https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/typescript.html#Augmenting-Types-for-Use-with-PluginsOk, thank you, @HerringtonDarkholme.
I was looking for a strongly typed way for a component to get the name of it's children.
Probably a bad idea to rely on an undocumented property...
So for now I'll have my .vue templates export ComponentOptions (unstead of Vue.extend({})), which according to spec (https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/start/spec.html ) is preffered anyway.

A child (testchild.vue)
`export default <ComponentOptions<Vue>>{
		name: ""testchild""
	};`

A parent can then import that into any variable, and use it thusly.
`
import blahblah from 'testchild.vue';

export default <ComponentOptions<Vue>>{
	name: 'test',
	components: {
		[blahblah.name]: blahblah
	}
}
`

Instead of having to hard code the name, again, or rely on the name given to the import to match the component name.

I think that this is a bit verbose and unnecessary; perhaps later I'll open a feature request.In the end that's not a good solution: If I specify the type as <ComponentOptions<Vue>>, accessing properties causes type errors:
`
...
methods: {
		...mapActions([actions.clearFilters]),

		clearFilters() {
			this.clearFilters();
		}
...`

Because the default Vue instance doesn't have a clearFilters method.
Oh well.
Named exports should work.",

There are methods like `isTrue`, `isFalse`, `isObject` in `shared/util`, so why don't create similar for `isString` ?

Mixing different levels of abstraction (`isObject` near `typeof value === 'string'`) is not a good practice.

As said lusarz, there is methods like isTrue|isFalse|isObject|isPrimitive, so i dont see over-engineering here",What do you think about `return isString(value) ? transformSpecialNewlines(value) : JSON.stringify(value)` notation ?

But I also wonder if there is any technical benefit from not having class names repeated
I don't think it's worth the overhead to remove the duplicates (this is a serious one as it will be called on every class name render), and having duplicate class names doesn't really harm anything.","What do you think about:

    const staticClasses = (staticClass || '').split(' ')
    const dynamicClasses = (stringifyClass(dynamicClass) || '').split(' ')
    return Array.from(new Set([...staticClasses, ...dynamicClasses])).join(' ')

instead of L39 - L85 ? This is what I wrote initially but then I couldn't get tests to pass in PhantomJS. Multiple tests fail with `TypeError: undefined is not a constructor`. This is because `Array.from` is not available in PhantomJS( and IE). Ok, I understand. Sorry I didn't check it before writing my comment.

 If you want you can probably use solution:

    return concat(staticClass, stringifyClass(dynamicClass))

fenduru,8019,,"fix(slots): preserve reactivity inside of $slots, fix #7856",closed,2018-04-13,"Previously $slots was not reactive which caused use cases such as
portal-vue to not update when the contents of the slots updated. This
was because there were no reactive properties accessed when using $slots
and renders were only being triggered by calls to $forceUpdate when slot
contents changed.

This change makes $slots reactive, so updates are detected appropriately
regardless of where the slot is used.

**Other information:**
Prevents `Property 'oldValue' is missing in type '{ name: string; value: string; }'.` when using directives in a render function (see test). 

There should probably actually be three different `VNodeDirective`s:
 - In `h('', data)` - mostly optional, not readonly
 - In `VNodeData` (returned from createElement) - normalised, not readonly
 - In `DirectiveFunction` - the current definition (before this change)",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/8003,"['types/options.d.ts', 'types/test/options-test.ts', 'types/vnode.d.ts']",,['8013'],"You're right, `console.log(h('div', { directives: [{ name: 'something' }] }))` only has `name`. Inspecting the vnode after it's mounted shows `def, modifiers, name`. 

`Vue.directive('something', (el, binding) => { console.log(binding) })` also only has those three defined. 

I'm thinking there should still be a separate definition for in vs out though, `modifiers` is always defined as an empty object but it doesn't make sense to pass that in through `h`. 

Edit: yeah, forgot to check this after the change:

Please check: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7280#issuecomment-379529594",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7981,['src/core/observer/index.js'],,,,"Then when have the chance to invoke customSetter?@dsonet 

**The following content is my understanding, there may be incorrect place.**

The first thing we can guarantee is that if the value of the `property` property is `undefined`, both the value of `getter` and `setter` will be `undefined`:
```js
/* defineReactive */
const property = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, key)
// If `property === undefined`, both `setter` and `getter` are undefined
const getter = property && property.get
const setter = property && property.set
```
The `customSetter` method is mainly used to print prompt information when the property value is set, and mainly used in the following aspects:

* Define the injected value on the instance object:

```js
/* inject.js  initInjections */
defineReactive(vm, key, result[key], customSetter)
```
At this point, the return value of `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(vm, key)` is `undefined`, so both `getter` and `setter` are `undefined`

* Define the `$attrs` and `$listeners` properties on the instance object:

```js
/* render.js  initRender */
    defineReactive(vm, '$attrs', parentData && parentData.attrs || emptyObject, () => {
      !isUpdatingChildComponent && warn(`$attrs is readonly.`, vm)
    }, true)
    defineReactive(vm, '$listeners', options._parentListeners || emptyObject, () => {
      !isUpdatingChildComponent && warn(`$listeners is readonly.`, vm)
    }, true)
```

We can still guarantee that the following statement's value is `undefined`:

```js
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(vm, '$attrs') // undefined
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(vm, '$listeners') // undefined
```

* Define the props data on the `vm._props` object:

```js
/* state  initProps */
const props = vm._props = {}
defineReactive(props, key, value, customSetter)
```

The value of `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(props, key)` is `undefined`„ÄÇ

In summary, when the value of the `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor method` is `undefined`, both the `getter` and the `setter` are `undefined`, so `(getter && !setter)` will always be `false` and will not affect the execution of the `customSetter`.But won't it make the code harder to maintain? Since every time you add a call to `defineReactive` with `customSetter` you'll have to check all these conditions.

IMHO, as this refactor aims to get rid of unnecessary observation, putting the `getter` and `setter` check right before assigning to `val` might be easier to understand.you are right@sodatea I have made some changes."
sodatea,7980,,fix(core): fix dependency collection for computed properties (fix #7960),open,2018-04-07,"This fix addresses a regression introduced in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/653aac2c57d15f0e93a2c1cc7e6fad156658df19, by altering the order of `watcher.evaluate` and `watcher.depend`, thus preventing the `Vue.set`s in a computed property getter from
accidentally clearing the `deps` array of the computed watcher.

So far, the only workaround is to change the 'vue-loader' in webpack but by adding this it would be possible to use the actual official 'vue-loader' and change only the necessary part.

## Description
* fix: stop render when failed setAttr
    * ex) when render compiled editable jade/pug texts, there are cases that have incorrect attrs.
    * change: stop render -> render & logging Vue warn",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7953,['src/platforms/web/runtime/modules/attrs.js'],,,"Thanks for the PR but adding a try/catch would slow down the code when the problem comes from the code written in a different templating language.
Can you show us what cases is this helping out?
If it is ever added, it must be added in development mode onlyThanks for reply.

I wanted to make Pug editor preview.

I didn't know that try-catch makes code slow down.
I think this try-catch doesn't have to be added in dev mode.
Because my probrem occurs in production mode too.

I want to resolve the problem by other approach.
But I can't catch this Error anywhere.
I tried Vue.config.errorHandler and renderError, but Vue.js stops before catching the error.
I want to catch the error in renderError.
Do you have any good ideas?

I'm not sure if this case is an issue for you.
Does the problem need to be reported to  `GitHub issues`?can you show us a sample that led you to create this PR, please?",

**Other information:**
Hey, I am a member of a group of students (@LarsStegman, @PhilipeLouchtch, @TimSpeelman) that has been analysing Vue for the course Software Architecture. As part of this course it was suggested to create a contribution to reduce technical debt.
During this analysis we found that the filter parser was hard to understand,
this PR is supposed to remedy this by adding additional documentation.
String (single, double, template quoted) and regex matching have been overhauled to use a special method to seek the ending quote instead, this effectively behaves the same as the code did before.

We ran a benchmark with a weird filter string, the result of which indicated there is no degradation in performance.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7948,"['src/compiler/parser/filter-parser.js', 'test/unit/features/filter/filter.spec.js']",,,,

It is nothing new, as `scopedSlots` already exist on `data`. The only reasons to add it are convenience and consistency with `slots` (although `slots` is a function).

> **These modifications only take effects on Weex platform.**

This is a partial feature of recycle-list.

Because of there is no virtual dom in virtual components, the event handler can only be bind on the virtual component template, but the event handler should be executed in the virtual component context (refer to this [brief explanation](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000013697211#articleHeader13)). So at least two processes should be changed to support this feature.

**1. Using dynamic `this` for the event handler**

When compiling the `v-on` directive, the expression will be compiled into a handler function. Along with the `with(this){}` magic, the handler function's context (`this`) always be same as the render function. But it should be dynamic for virtual components, the real context of the event handler could be re-assigned at runtime.

To achieve this, I added an explicit `this` to the event handlers which are used in recyclable components.  ([platforms/weex/compiler/modules/event.js#L45-L60](https://github.com/Hanks10100/vue/blob/6be2fc83130c1aa1cf696800a2b7fb23eec9f6e1/src/platforms/weex/compiler/modules/event.js#L45-L60)) 

**2. Finding the expected context when invoking the event handler.**

At runtime, if an event is dispatched to a virtual component template, then find the real context by `componentId` and invoke the handler in the expected context. ([platforms/weex/runtime/modules/events.js#L48-L65](https://github.com/Hanks10100/vue/blob/6be2fc83130c1aa1cf696800a2b7fb23eec9f6e1/src/platforms/weex/runtime/modules/events.js#L48-L65))

Actually it'll lead a failure to `test:cover` and `test:e2e`. I have tried on my local machine, but I am not sure about how to solve it.

I guess the reason is the `require` which are used in the weex compiler.

If I [comment out those ""requires""](https://github.com/Hanks10100/vue/compare/weex-event-handler...Hanks10100:07bb0545a64fc5291f7797e09f0623babd6b8409), of course the `test:weex` and type check will be failed, but [the `test:e2e` and `test:cover` will be passed](https://github.com/Hanks10100/vue/pull/6). So I think these modified codes won't cause a failure to the test cases, but the test driver (PhantomJS or Karma) can't work well with the CommonJS module syntax (`require`). I thought those codes would be *shaking off* while compiling, because of those packages only be used in the weex compiler.

@yyx990803 Do you have any idea to solve the ci failures?",

Here's an initial implementation of Prettier integration, with changes made to each file so that we can see how the source would change. Once we've confirmed the configs in `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc` look good, I think it would be a good idea to do the following prior to merging:

- Build the Prettier ESLint overrides into `eslint-plugin-vue-libs`.
- Ship the Prettier config with `eslint-plugin-vue-libs`, so that we can maintain consistency between projects with the following in a `.prettierrc.js` file:

  ```js
  module.exports = require('eslint-plugin-vue-libs/.prettierrc.js')

``` vue
<child v-bind=""{ scopedSlots: $scopedSlots }"">
</child>
```

close #7178, close #7351 ",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7765,"['src/core/instance/render-helpers/bind-object-props.js', 'test/unit/features/component/component-scoped-slot.spec.js']",,"['7178', '7351']","Btw, this is still open to discussion, since the syntax isn't entirely consistent.

You can do `v-bind=""{ ref: 'foo', slot: 'bar' }""` which makes sense because `ref` and `slot` can be bound individually as attributes, but `scopedSlots` is not.

Internally `ref` and `slot` are treated specially because they are ""reserved"" attributes and thus merged into the VNode's data as a root-level property.

So alternatively, we can expose a special convention for `v-bind`: if a property starts with `$`, it will always be merged as a root-level property into the VNode's data.

This then allows the usage:

``` vue
<child v-bind=""{ $scopedSlots } />
```

In addition, if you know the underlying [VNode data interface](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html#The-Data-Object-In-Depth), you can also do low-level stuff without dropping into render functions:

``` vue
<child v-bind=""{
  $on: {
    someEvent: someMethod
  },
  $nativeOn: {
    click: someMethod
  }
}""/>
```What about adding a dedicated directive for merging vnode data? Since `v-bind` is used to be used for passing parent component data to child component attribute/props, it is a bit weird if it can modify underlying vnode data, IMHO.

If we have such directive we can simply write the vnode data as the same shape as in render function (named it `v-vnode` as a placeholder üòâ ):

```vue
<child v-vnode=""{
  scopedSlots: $scopedSlots,
  on: {
    someEvent: someMethod
  },

```

We may write directive argument like `v-bind`:

```vue
<child v-vnode:scoped-slots=""$scopedSlots"" />
```

This also has a benefit that we may able to write template type checker for that as we can simply utilize Vue's typescript typings. (FYI: The current WIP implementation of template type checker is [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/pull/681))The specific directive proposed by @ktsn seems a little awkward to me, but I think it would make sense to separate the behavior to improve readability.What's the status of this?So is there a consensus on using a different tag name or not? If so, what should it be called? 

Otherwise, this is clearly a hangup for a lot of people using Vue (googling led me to 5-6 different issues on the same topic) and it'd be nice to either give this a thumbs up or have some direction in what needs to be done to get this shipped.

As an added note, the current ""solution"" of using a `render` function is pretty silly, especially when templates get complex and/or are already written and are getting new components added to them.I wouldn't recommend this solution, but I needed this functionality now - so I implemented @yyx990803 's change as a plugin:

```javascript
var BindScopedSlotsPlugin = {
  install: function(Vue, options) {
    Vue.prototype._b = function bindObjectProps (
      data,
      tag,
      value,
      asProp,
      isSync
    ) {
      if (value) {
        if (value === null || typeof value !== 'object') {
          warn(
            'v-bind without argument expects an Object or Array value',
            this
          );
        } else {
          if (Array.isArray(value)) {
            var res = {};
            for (var i = 0; i < value.length; i++) {
              if (value[i]) {
                Vue.util.extend(res, value[i]);
              }
            }
            value = res;
          }
          var hash;
          var loop = function ( key ) {
            if (
              key === 'class' ||
              key === 'style' ||
              key === 'scopedSlots' || // new code
              Vue.config.isReservedAttr(key)
            ) {
              hash = data;
            } else {
              var type = data.attrs && data.attrs.type;
              hash = asProp || Vue.config.mustUseProp(tag, type, key)
                ? data.domProps || (data.domProps = {})
                : data.attrs || (data.attrs = {});
            }
            if (!(key in hash)) {
              hash[key] = value[key];

              if (isSync) {
                var on = data.on || (data.on = {});
                on[(""update:"" + key)] = function ($event) {
                  value[key] = $event;
                };
              }
            }
          };

          for (var key in value) loop( key );
        }
      }
      return data;
    };
  }
};

Vue.use( BindScopedSlotsPlugin );
```

The syntax is as mentioned initially: `v-bind=""{ scopedSlots: $scopedSlots }""`@ClickerMonkey thanks for building the plugin! there is a tiny typo: `if (arr[i])` needs to be replaced with `if (value[i])`‚Ä¶Thanks! I have a smaller simpler version:

```javascript
    Vue.prototype._b = (function (bind) {
      return function(data, tag, value, asProp, isSync) {
        if (value && value.$scopedSlots) {
          data.scopedSlots = value.$scopedSlots;
          delete value.$scopedSlots;
        }
        return bind.apply(this, arguments);
      };
    })(Vue.prototype._b);
```

And you just need to add `v-bind=""{$scopedSlots}""` to the component.

In my opinion this PR is off-topic whatsoever, because it doesn't have much to do with that purpose.All syntax examples should serve as a model for best code practice.IMO always using shorthand properties is hardly best practice. This makes you set unnecessary property values, in this case, `font-family`.Thanks, we in general do not modify examples unless for behavioral changes.","What's wrong with the original declarations? There's no need to define `font-family` here.In an actual live implementation of the code we can assume that a font-family would be defined. The current code omits this and leaves the font-family of the h1 tag to be determined by the browser.

e.g.
font-weight: 300;
font-size: 1.8em;
font-family: x;

Thus, we can shorten future logic into:
font: 300 1.8em x;Omitting a property can be intentional. That‚Äôs why we have longhand properties."

It's not how CSS works. The computed `font-family` will be `Roboto` no matter it's available or not. Further fallback is provided by the browsers.

Honestly I think current code is fine enough.It works but I omitted 'inherit'. 

``
font: 300 1.8em Arial, inherit;
``

Check it ‚úÖ`inherit` is a CSS keyword, not `<family-name>`s or `<generic-family>`s which are valid inside a `font-family` property value. It can only be used as the whole value of a property. The modified version still won't work as you expected, it's even not a valid value...I've attached a demo of how it works.
[eg-of-fallback.html.zip](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/files/1750862/eg-of-fallback.html.zip)
The `font-family` is inherited from ancestor element because you are making the whole `font` property invalid, not because `Roboto` isn't available.confirmed.",

I'll see if I can implement that in another PR.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7598,"['flow/compiler.js', 'src/compiler/parser/index.js', 'test/unit/modules/compiler/parser.spec.js']",,,"After turning on those options, my production build sizes have decreased by 4-10% without any negative side effects at all.

Enabling the `trimTextWhitespace` option will trim away whitespace characters **around** each text node:
```javascript
_c('p',[_vm._v(""\r\n\t\tText     \t\n\t    Line 1\r\n\t\t""), ...])
_c('p',[_vm._v(""\r\n\t\tText   Line 2\r\n\t\t""), ...])
```
```javascript
_c('p',[_vm._v(""Text     \t\n\t    Line 1""), ...])
_c('p',[_vm._v(""Text   Line 2""), ...])
```


Enabling the `collapseTextWhitespace` option will collapse sequences of multiple whitespace characters within the **whole** text node (also at the beginning and end), similiarly to what a browser does:
```javascript
_c('p',[_vm._v(""\r\n\t\tText     \t\n\t    Line 1\r\n\t\t""), ...])
_c('p',[_vm._v(""\r\n\t\tText   Line 2\r\n\t\t""), ...])
```
```javascript
_c('p',[_vm._v("" Text\nLine 1 ""), ...])
_c('p',[_vm._v("" Text Line 2 ""), ...])
```


Enabling both options will obviously result in the best outcome, with all whitespace reduced to a minimum:
```javascript
_c('p',[_vm._v(""\r\n\t\tText     \t\n\t    Line 1\r\n\t\t""), ...])
_c('p',[_vm._v(""\r\n\t\tText   Line 2\r\n\t\t""), ...])
```
```javascript
_c('p',[_vm._v(""Text\nLine 1""), ...])
_c('p',[_vm._v(""Text Line 2""), ...])
```

[vue-loader#1151](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/pull/1151) has a PR for pulling in those options from the webpack configuration, and I have a second commit waiting, which would enable setting these two options and the already existing `preserveWhitespace` on a per-SFC-file basis: 
```vue
<template whitespaces=""not-preserve,trim,collapse"">
	<div>
		Text Line 1
		<p>
			Text Line 2

		</p>
		<p>
			Text	Line 3
		</p>
		Text    Line 4
		Text Line 5
	</div>
</template>
```

Ideally these options should be set to `true` by default, but my PR has them set to `false` so that it's non-breaking, even non-changing at all.
*Edit: As described in below comments, only the collapse option can be safely turned on; enabling the  trim option might lead to unwanted behaviour with inline elements.*

I'm looking forward to hearing what you guys think.Excited to see this! Great work!Really looking forward to it!

Just one wish:
I think this should not remove whitespaces, but replace them with a single space.
Like this you don't have issues where the browser renders a whitespace.
E.g. `text node 1 .. inline node .. text node 2` (all as siblings)
Here the browser will render text node 1's trailing whitespace and text node 2's leading whitespace.
If you trim each whitespace to a single space, the behaviour is not changed at all.@econic Thanks for the input. You're totally right that trimming would be fatal in that case. If you only enable the collapse setting and not the trim one though, it should work out fine, as the whitespaces around the text nodes will be collapsed down to a single ASCII-space and not be completely removed.

If this PR is ever accepted, it'd probably be a safe bet to enable the collapse option by default, as this really shouldn't change behaviour, but reduce component size a lot. The trim option might break existing code and should stay off for now, and has a rather negligible effect any way; the major reduction occurs by collapsing `""\t\t\t\t\t\t""` down to just `"" ""` many times (depending on your project size).",

**Other information:**

This PR adds a new function `Vue.prototype.$notify`, which works basically like `$emit`, except it returns an array that collects all return values of its event callbacks.

**Motivation:**

Developers of an component may want to collect data from callbacks of an event. There are a few options to do this:

1. Bind a function directly into the component. But it forces users of the component to write a function or needs the creator of the component writes property type checks to determine whether the prop value is callable or not.
2. Pass a callback parameter for the event. But nobody wants callbacks today.

To solve this issue, I'd like `$emit` or something else returns an array that collects all return values of its event callbacks. In order not to break old code, the behavior of `$emit` was kept ( which returns this ), but I wrote a new function instead. The function name `$notify` is not decided, but I can't come up with a better name.

Related issue: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5443
Related question: https://segmentfault.com/q/1010000011143372",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7465,"['flow/component.js', 'src/core/instance/events.js', 'test/unit/features/directives/on.spec.js', 'types/test/vue-test.ts', 'types/vue.d.ts']",,,"I'm not a huge fan of this because it is impossible to know the order in which the callbacks get executed.

When I encounter a situation where I want to get something back from an `$emit`, I usually pass a callback or a deferred as part of the arguments like so:

```javascript
// callback can be called multiple times by different consumers...
this.$emit(""get-something"", arg, (value) => {
    // Do stuff with value
})
```

Use it like so:

```javascript
this.$on(""get-something"", (arg, done) => {
    // Send a value back to the emitting component
    if (done) done(""hello from consumer"")
})
```

This manner creates a more predictable outcome where the developer decides whether to send a value back. It also allows for an alternative situation where you can only listen for a single value using a deferred like so:

```javascript
var callback
const deferred = new Promise((resolve) => { callback = resolve })

// callback will only save the value of the first caller
this.$emit(""get-something"", arg, callback)

deferred.then((value) => {
    // Do something with resolved value
})
```Thanks for the PR - however, I agree w/ @sirlancelot and I think explicit callbacks is more straightforward.It's 2018. I don't think callbacks are a good design anymore.

What I want to write is:

```js
const values = await Promise.all(vm.$emit('event', arg))
```

Instead of

```js
var promises = []
vm.$emit('event', arg, promise => {
  promises.push(promise)
})
const values = await Promise.all(promises)
```

returning vm itself for $emit is almost useless. It's not jQuery or lodash and you don't need to chain the operations in 99% cases (there's no UT to ensure this by the way). But it's a common use case that returning values from event handler, for example filtering list remotely. Using return value instead of vender callbacks is much easier to use and a rather modern design nowadays.

> I'm not a huge fan of this because it is impossible to know the order in which the callbacks get executed.

Values in the returned array of `$notify` are still ordered. Besides I think most of the use cases is `@event=""handler""` thus no order is needed.

What you get using callback is just `the callback is called BEFORE executing the next handler`, but you get no benefit from this. You can't stop the event bus ( by throwing exceptions or something else ). If you want to return something from the callback, it must be a design error.

If you do, just fall back to callbacks.

@yyx990803 @sirlancelot any thoughts?Well... It's 2018. I don't think event-ping-ponging is a good design anymore. **It makes the flow of your application very hard to reason about for those who are not familiar with the codebase**. I don't want to encourage this kind of patterns. If you insist, you don't have to get this into Vue core to use it. [Just write your own plugin](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/plugins.html).> It makes the flow of your application very hard to reason about for those who are not familiar with the codebase.

I agree. But it's not avoidable. There are lots of similar [real requirements](http://element-cn.eleme.io/#/zh-CN/component/select#select-attributes) need to be resolved.

The element-ui developers chose to use binding function as property. I ( and maybe others ) used `@event` at first and of course found it didn't work.

Now I'm facing this problem. I have chosen to use binding function too but I think things can be better.

I do this because own implementation is slower than native -- https://jsperf.com/vue-bind-perf
I didn't know how to check perfomance for select implementation.

hm, in most modern browsers it will be good change, but i didn't know how it be work in weex. Should i save own `bind` implementation?Maybe just reimplement current `bind` as something like:
```js
function bind (fn, ctx) {
  return fn.bind(ctx)
}
```
as an easy to revert solution for the start?","This file is generated by `npm run build:weex`, no need to patch this.Other than code patch, will using native bind benefit weex? I wonder.In my opinion, using js tricks to optimise native APIs is not a good solution. JS engines are changing all the time, this trick may not always efficient.

For Weex, it's possible to optimise the JS engine directly if the native bind has performance issues."

Feel free to close this PR if it's not something we need to support (I've only done it because I've been reading through the issues, and this seemed like a quick one). I'm not sure if there's a better way than importing Vue, I couldn't find a way to resolve a globally registered component.

However, as its name indicates, `parsePath` only handle path name delimited by dot, like `obj.pathName.noSpace`. Bracket indexing expression `ob['some pathh']` isn't supported. So we cannot accept space in path.@HerringtonDarkholme how is it not supported though? How do you access the dot delimited properties? Isn't bracket index expression the only way? I've been using it for a few hours and it's working fine for me, I can imagine there might be some breaking bugs but I thought that since you're parsing a string into paths all you do is split on a dot, I wrote a library that uses the same principle, I can't see any reason to be splitting on anything but a dot and doing anything else with the property strings, split or not split, do they get processed at all besides splitting on dot?`grep -R parsePath src -A 9`

```
src/core/util/lang.js:export function parsePath (path: string): any {
src/core/util/lang.js-  if (bailRE.test(path)) {
src/core/util/lang.js-    return
src/core/util/lang.js-  }
src/core/util/lang.js-  const segments = path.split('.')
src/core/util/lang.js-  return function (obj) {
src/core/util/lang.js-    for (let i = 0; i < segments.length; i++) {
src/core/util/lang.js-      if (!obj) return
src/core/util/lang.js-      obj = obj[segments[i]]
src/core/util/lang.js-    }
--
src/core/observer/watcher.js:      this.getter = parsePath(expOrFn)
src/core/observer/watcher.js-      if (!this.getter) {
src/core/observer/watcher.js-        this.getter = function () {}
src/core/observer/watcher.js-        process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' && warn(
src/core/observer/watcher.js-          `Failed watching path: ""${expOrFn}"" ` +
src/core/observer/watcher.js-          'Watcher only accepts simple dot-delimited paths. ' +
src/core/observer/watcher.js-          'For full control, use a function instead.',
src/core/observer/watcher.js-          vm
src/core/observer/watcher.js-        )
src/core/observer/watcher.js-      }
```

Another occurence is omitted here because it is a simple import statement.@HerringtonDarkholme 

`obj = obj[segments[i]]` So it's using bracket notation?> The expression only accepts simple dot-delimited paths. For more complex expression, use a function instead.

Let me clarify what does this mean. `parsePath` is only used in `$watch` and `$watch`'s string argument only accepts simple dot-delimited path as convienence.

Dot-delimited path is a simple and valid expression in JavaScript, while `obj.some path` isn't.
Whether it works coincidentally with current implementation or not doesn't matter whether it is appropriate to be accepted as a public API.

Consider, if space can be accepted as object path, why minus, divide cannot? I can conceive a lot of CSS-in-JS users will use `background-color` as key name. Accepting non identifier symbol just breaks the simple concept of dot-delimiteed path.

Please do use function as watcher expression. Indeed, Iyou can use your own wrapper function in your application.

```ts
function p(path) {
   const segments = path.split('.')
   return function () {
     const obj = this
     for (let i = 0; i < segments.length; i++) {
       if (!obj) return
       obj = obj[segments[i]]
     }
     return obj
   }
}

this.$watch(p('my space.my api.my data'), handler)
// only three more characters, and two more key strokes if a decent editor is used
```@HerringtonDarkholme ohh you can actually pass the object straight through, that works well, I'm using a get function like that already to build objects out of strings, hence why I was surprised the watch function didn't allow spaces.

In my opinion having spaces is pretty awesome for readability and in general. 

I don't believe it's a non-identifier symbol is it? I just read up on the variable name javascript docs a little`$watch`'s expression parse is intentionally limited - it's meant as a convenience API only. Using a full-blown path parser would bloat the codebase for marginal benefits - anything more complex than dot-delimited paths should use a function getter instead.",

i appreciate the interest in this feature and also respect your time in creating, however I don't think that increasing the scope, complexity and maintenance of Vue core is worth the cost of this feature because it could be handled in userland.@Austio It's happy (and rare) to see users ask for not adding a feature üòÑ . I do share the same sentiment with you. Let's move the discussion to the original issue #6913 and keep pull request thread for code review.I'm closing this since I share a similar concern (the tradeoff between codebase complexity vs. the benefits).

Instead, I think we should look at how to make scoped slots syntax even simpler so a less-verbose userland helper component becomes possible.","I'd rather see the other way around `foo.bar as v` or a different _more js friendly_ syntax (which allows to create multiple variables):

```html
<div v-local:v=""foo.bar"" v-lobal:baz=""foo.bar.baz"">
```

At the end, it would still be valid js. It can even be aliased to something like `<div $v=""foo.bar""`Those are my thoughts on the feature. That being said, I feel that this crosses the line of Javascript/Magic even though I see when it can be comfortable to use üôÇ updatedI think we need another test for combining v-for, scoped slot and v-local together as scoped vFor is handled separately IIRC. updated,
1. add some test for scoped slot 
2. fix invalid v-local in scoped-slot with template tagAfter some deeper thoughts, `v-local` might be harder than I originally estimated. The root problem is it adds a new way to introduce new variable in template. After this, we will have three way to introduce new variables:

1. v-for
2. slot-scope
3. v-local

With 1 and 2 we already have some ordering issue, https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6817. I would say more variable introduction isn't scalable in current implementation. For example, `<div v-local:items=""foo.deep.prop"" v-for=""item in items"">` is still missing in test. And supporting such usage will require yet another patch in `genFor`."

2. The second change is about type checking of method value. Code `methods[key] != null` was added in [pull request#3656](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/3656) to checking for undefined properties. 
But when we call the method which type is number or string, not function, it will give a ambiguous error message too.

**Other information:**
The reason I'm submitting this PR is because for `nativescript-vue` we would like to introduce code-sharing between web and native, but one limiting factor is that we can't have more than 1 `template` or `script` tag in a SFC.

We would like to write our SFC like so:
```html
<template native>
    <StackLayout></StackLayout>
</template>
<template web>
    <div></div>
</template>

<style native>
    StackLayout { background: red; }
</style>
<style web>
    div { background: red; }
</style>

<script>
    export default {
        methods: {} // the core code
    }
</script>
<script native>
    export default {
        methods: {} // methods that interact with the UI.
    }
</script>
<script web>
    export default {
        methods: {} // methods that interact with the UI.
    }
</script>
```

(More information can be found at https://github.com/tralves/ns-vue-loader/issues/2)

The current implementation assumes only 1 of these blocks, and only the last one is kept, with this PR it will parse all of the blocks, and return them in an array, while keeping it backwards compatible.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7264,"['flow/compiler.js', 'src/sfc/parser.js', 'test/unit/modules/sfc/sfc-parser.spec.js']",,,"This is great!
My 2 cents: I think having an attribute `name` (or similar) on the template and script to identify them would also allow us to build an object instead of an array and always take the one without a name or (`name=""default""`) instead of the last defined template or script
@posva We could add a name attribute, but that would limit us with syntax, unless we auto-generate a name (`default`, `template-1`, `template-2`, etc.) when none is provided. For nativescript-vue it could work like 

```html
<template></template> <!-- default -->
<template name=""native""></template>
```

But I still think it is nicer to have / write like so

```html
<template web></template>
<template native></template>
```
The reason I'm proposing an attribute with a value is because it doesn't make sense to write `<template web native>`, which is possible, and this is because the real attribute in your case is the platform, which can be native or web. The other way feels like web and native are boolean attributesCan't we solve the problem from the build layer i.e. having multiple files (`component.(native|web).vue` or `(native|web)/component.vue` etc.) and configuring Webpack in a certain way? Having all templates and scripts in the same file would make it harder to maintain between different developers IMO, and the files would grow quite fat in no time.> The reason I'm proposing an attribute with a value is because it doesn't make sense to write `<template web native>`, which is possible, and this is because the real attribute in your case is the platform, which can be native or web.

That's a valid point, but I would leave that to the tool to validate what should / shouldn't be possible

> Can't we solve the problem from the build layer i.e. having multiple files (component.(native|web).vue or (native|web)/component.vue etc.) and configuring Webpack in a certain way? Having all templates and scripts in the same file would make it harder to maintain between different developers IMO, and the files would grow quite fat in no time.

Sure we can, but I would leave this up to the tool / loader to decide. For example we plan on doing more than just compiling one `.vue` file for web and one for native, we will utilize mixins to automatically merge platform specific code with platform-independent code and I think it would make sense to have it in a single file (we will only know if this is feasible once we try it).

(edit: fixed formatting)I personally feel the syntax is less maintainable than @phanan 's suggestion. What I'd personally do is:

``` bash
- Foo.web.vue
- Foo.native.vue
- Foo.shared.js # shared between web and native
- Foo.shared.scss # shared between web and native
```

The shared js can be imported by both `*.vue` files and used as a mixin, or a base for `extends`. If a convention is used (e.g. if file ends with `.shared.js`), this can be done automatically without modifying the SFC syntax.

The shared CSS can be SASS mixins or whatever reuse mechanism the pre-processor allows. Again, can be done automatically.

Note that we want to keep the SFC syntax as consistent possible, because it involves a big ecosystem of tools that need to support any new features added (e.g. Vetur would need to do something very different for handling SFCs with multiple scripts/templates). The proposed syntax, IMO, does not justify adding the new syntax.I do understand that there is a big ecosystem around SFC syntax, although I do not think this addition would require all the tooling to support it, since there are no breaking changes. It would only allow us to experiment with the new syntax in our own loader implementation without maintaining a fork of the parser. 

We will keep experimenting with the proposed syntax using my fork, to see how it works out in the real world.

Thanks for your feedback!@rigor789 yeah, I think exploring in a fork would be a plausible step for now, we can revisit this with more real world feedback.@yyx990803 Absolutely! Thanks is there any repo for this?

",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7171,['src/core/instance/render-helpers/render-list.js'],,,"Iterator can be infinite no? Would that be a problem?echo @Gudradain's comment, we need to add a limit to this (maybe with a default value), but the same could go for traditional Array with excessive amount of data (so it's virtually infinite)Related: #5893So I have been using the following for a while now: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/cb062c50cdd21628dcf758fe54c84d17d75cb2ca/src/core/instance/render-helpers/render-list.js

I have checked the spec and MapIterator's `@@toStringTag` symbol returns `Map Iterator`. The similar for other iterators.

GIven this, I suspect if a `toString` test is legitimate. Checking `Symbol.iterator` in proper environment is better, I think.Yes, the better way is checking Symbol.iterator. At first I thought I can't use the ES6 grammar.`Symbol.toStringTag`

It seems that @ktsn and I had the same problem at the same time, as I separately found and fixed the problem identified in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7131 with this PR.  I noticed @HerringtonDarkholme had open questions about the `never` type.  My solution to the problem was a separate overload for `Vue.extend` and `Vue.component` that involves a third typed props type. I'm not expert enough on typescript to know which of these is a better solution, but I figured I'd open the duplicate-ish PR since I had a different approach in case you prefer it.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7132,"['types/options.d.ts', 'types/vue.d.ts']",,,"Thanks for your  contribution!

After investigation, I think `never` type shouldn't be the issue. And @ktsn 's solution is arguably more succinct. So I hope you wouldn't mind if this pull request is going to be closed.

Thank you any way for this pull request!ref: #7135

**Other information:**

Previously, if the user does not include `props` option in component options, `ThisType` has `Record<string, any>` in the members of intersection types. Then `this.notExistingProperty` is already passed if `props` options is missed.

```ts
export default Vue.extend({
  data() {
    this.notExistingProperty // <- this should be an error but currently isn't.
  }
})
```

I added a default type parameter of `Vue.component` and `Vue.extend` to avoid to allow any properties in `ThisType` when there is no `props` option.

I did not add a test for this because we need to check a compilation error to confirm that üòõ ",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7131,['types/vue.d.ts'],,,"Thanks! IIRC the default `never` is removed by me because some usages cannot be compiled.

But it might be caused by other typing and I've mistaken it with `never`. I need some more experiment to confirm it.I have investigated this issue; a lot of compiling error in TS2.6.1, :(

It turns out that `never` bound isn't the culprit but `Component`.

`Component` is declared as the union of two `ThisTyped` options. This makes `ComponentOptions` not assignable to `Component`.

So this is a good fix! Thanks!

And I will make a pull request to fix `Component` issue.@HerringtonDarkholme Thanks for investigation!

@gzzhanghao Thanks!  Size overhead seems to be acceptable! Thanks again!","I might be wrong, but `warn`'s second parameter seems to accept `Vue vm` instance, but `getRawAttr` returns `AstAttr` Can you add a test for `getRawBindingAttr`, I mean,  `<div v-bind:key=""wrong-key"">` should return an error with `:key`'s range, even if we call `getRawBindingAttr(el, 'key')`.A bit nit-picky, but `setRange` implies side-effect, `rangeSetItem` might be a better naming.This is a quadratic time complexity.

Thanks @yyx990803 , the new `vue.esm.browser.js` looks good, should it be mentioned in [dist/README.md](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/dist/README.md)?
Is it expected the new dist file is already included in the vue package (before this PR is merged)?
https://unpkg.com/vue@2.5.16/dist/vue.esm.browser.js
`dist/vue.esm.browser.js` seems to exist since version `2.5.9`, and its internal version is always `2.5.8`?Is this meant to be for development only? I see things like `productionTip: ""development"" !== 'production'` in the compiled file.Having the same question as @damianpeterson: will you add a `vue.esm.browser.min.js` production build as well?

from https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/dist#development-vs-production-mode:

> CommonJS and ES Module builds are intended for bundlers, therefore we don't provide minified versions for them. You will be responsible for minifying the final bundle yourself.

But with ESM in the browser we won't necessarily need bundlers anymore (depending on the project and its audience). For what I'm working on, I don't need template pre-compilation and runtime-only, but I would prefer a minified version (`vue.min.js` is 84 KB versus 284 KB unminified).I am already using this bundle in my project and can say that is working as expected. I am not sure why this file is already available after `npm install vue`, but I can't complain :smile: ",

As the docs says:

> Properties that start with _ or $ will not be proxied on the Vue instance because they may conflict with Vue‚Äôs internal properties and API methods. You will have to access them as vm.$data._property.`

But, this is a little bit hidden during development. It would be better if a warn could be raised to show developer that the data property will not be proxied on the Vue instance.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7089,"['src/core/instance/state.js', 'test/unit/features/instance/properties.spec.js']",,['7070'],"@posva How about this broken spec? And, as you said on the issue, isn't a little bit risky to proceed with this change as some users/plugins uses internally this kind of data?The broken test is using `$foo` and btw, is wrong because it should ready `$foo` from `this.$data` and not from `this` but it doesn't change anything having `undefined` or `{}` as the injected value.

I think I went too fast saying we could safely add a warning for this, sorry about that.
If users want to add properties to `data` that start with `$` or `_` they're free to do so, they only need to know that in order to access them, they have to use `this.$data`
I don't have any better idea that just drop this üôÅ
@chrisvfritz @sdras @LinusBorg do you have any feedback on how to improve this in case you have seen people falling under this _caveat_?
@posva I was willing to contribute and I didn‚Äôt think about the consequences or how it could impact users. I‚Äôm sorry üòï.

Having a warning ""uncaught"" with `toHaveBeenWarned` fails otherwise valid tests. Adding assertions about warnings seems excessive in those tests. What is the proper way to do it?

Also questions posed in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6877#issuecomment-344174202 are relevant. Currently names are `primary`, `secondary`, `auxiliary` for `left`, `right`, `middle` correspondingly.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7069,"['src/compiler/codegen/events.js', 'src/compiler/helpers.js', 'test/unit/features/directives/on.spec.js']",,,"Thanks for the PR!

I think it makes sense to assert that the warning has indeed been warned whenever it should be. That's the point of the warn check.

Naming looks good.

Final note: we probably won't merge/ship this until 2.6 since we want to avoid introducing deprecations in patch releases.Thank you!

I'll add the warn checks in a bit.

2.6 is totally fine. But if the new API is welcome in a patch release while deprecation warnings are not, and if it would be beneficial, I can move deprecation warnings into another PR that would wait for the minor version bump and keep new names with working old ones here for the patch.",

if a router has not set name :
```js
function getComponentName (opts) {
  return opts && (opts.Ctor.options.name || opts.tag)
}

this function will return undefined, so has some problems when use `keep-alive`

detail:https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6938
@yyx990803 ","why do you change the way of getting name? Plus doesn't need `componentOptions &&`  since it's already in the if branch.
IMO it should keep original logic ` opts.Ctor.options.name || opts.tag`  even if you want an optimization here which may not necessaryThanks for review , already modified.

docs descripition:
The match is first checked on the component‚Äôs own name option, then its local registration name (the key in the parent‚Äôs components option) if the name option is not available. Anonymous components cannot be matched against.

Anonymous components always have a registered name(  tag in code) , i think the descripition of docs may cause logical hole.

@cuteyumiko IMO we may need to keep `opts.tag`. For example:
``` js
const foo = {
  template: `<div>foo</div>`
}

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  components: {
    foo
  }
})
``` 

In above case, you'll find `Ctor.options` doesn't have a `name` property, but there actually is `tag` in it.ehhh..i see 
i have done another test for caching anonymous components , it turns out caching logic is ok

 #6938  it's problem may be casued by vue-router , i tracked this issue in a wrong way"

Is it going to get merged, and if so, when is it scheduled to get into an official release? Thanks.@javoski  I think adding this feature should allow **both** using `v-model` and `v-model.lazy`, and therefore, a component could potentially have 2 different events for model

---

_removed bad snippet of code, @javoski template solution is better_

or with a render function as well http://jsfiddle.net/dazvtwat/

I do agree to have `.lazy` makes it more succinct though üôÇ @posva Yeah, it's reasonable for components to aware of if they are using `.lazy` modifier on `v-model`, and prop is a proper way. 
But in the case of single input element wrapper component, I prefer to do like this:
```js
const MyComp = {
  ...
  template: `<input :value=""value"" @input=""onUpdate"" @change=""onUpdate"">`,
  methods: {
    onUpdate (e) {
      this.$emit(e.type, e.target.value)
    }
  }
}
```That's much better, indeed, completely forgot about `event.type` üòÑ 
But we should allow the user to customize both, `input` and `change` events name emitted by the component because the component can be used in both scenarios but only one event name can be provided, and if it is provided, it will end up used by both `v-model.lazy` and `v-model`",

**Other information:**
Encountered an issue where v-model would not try to call a setter on an instance of a class.
A basic example:

```
    <div>
        <input v-model=""person.fullName"">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>First Name</td>
                <td>{{ person.firstName }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Last Name</td>
                <td>{{ person.lastName }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Full Name</td>
                <td>{{ person.fullName }}</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
```
```
export class Person {
    constructor() {
        this.firstName = 'First'
        this.lastName = 'Last'
    }

    get fullName() {
        if (!this.lastName) {
            return this.firstName;
        }
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    }

    set fullName(v) {
        const split = v.split(' ', 2)
        this.firstName = split[0]
        this.lastName = split.length === 2 ? split[1] : ''
    }
}
```


In the above example the firstName and lastName don't change when the value of the input changes because the fullName setter is never called.

This PR fixes this by checking if we're trying to set a property that is defined as a setter in an object's prototype chain.
Because this explicitly checks for the presence of a .set on the property descriptor it will not try to set normal properties, to keep it more in line with how set has worked so far.

I'm guessing simply doing a (key in obj) check followed by a obj[key] = value would be more performant, but this being my first time looking at the Vue source code I'm not sure what this might break.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6934,"['src/core/observer/index.js', 'test/unit/modules/observer/observer.spec.js']",,,Thanks for the PR - this is actually `v-model` related and is already addressed in 83ed92608d81349e1cac2e481ed079e51a490b2b,

1. In 2.5 `ignoredElements` also support regular expressions.
2. Placing this check in `setAttr` can be too expensive. Ideally we don't want to affect performance of the entire framework for such a niche use case.@yyx990803 Thanks for your suggestions. I have a new idea:

1. Add a flag `isIgnoredElement` to `VNode`
2. Judge and set `isIgnoredElement` in [createElm](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.5.2/src/core/vdom/patch.js#L107)
3. In `setAttr`,  strip the default attribution process if `isIgnoredElement` is `true`

Would this be better?Thanks a lot for the PR. After re-consideration, I think the easier way to deal with this is simply checking if the element could be a custom one when setting the attribute. This avoids the overhead of adding flags to the vnode.",

",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6856,"['types/index.d.ts', 'types/options.d.ts', 'types/test/options-test.ts']",,,"This should also fix https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6841.

I wonder how it would impact case like `union: [User, Number]`. 

Of course, exporting more types means more compatibility for us to maintain. If it can also fix `union` case I think we should ship this feature.@HerringtonDarkholme it seems to work fine with union types where you want the constructor instead of the primitive:
![union](https://imgur.com/kMSrDZW.jpg)
![unionalso](https://imgur.com/bFlgCUK.jpg)To deal with union type, I guess it would be more convenient to declare another type (e.g. `PropType` in the following example) to unify the casting syntax.

```ts
type PropType<T> = Prop<T> | Prop<T>[]

interface Foo {
  a: string
}

Vue.extend({
  props: {
    // Both looks the same syntax
    // (we don't need to concern the `type` is an array or not)
    foo: Object as PropType<Foo>
    union: [Object, String] as PropType<Foo | string>
  }
})
````Prop<string | Foo>[]` is enough for union case. This is both concise and saves us one exported type.@HerringtonDarkholme, I think that @ktsn has a good point. That is technically the purpose of `PropValidator<T>` which serves as the all-encompassing union of `PropOptions<T> | Prop<T> | Prop<T>[]`. Would it be better to export `PropValidator<T>` instead so that users don't have to worry about conforming to the Vue prop validator syntax, and just do:
```ts
props: {
  myProp: {/* constructor, array, or prop options */} as PropValidator<IMyProp>
}
```@HerringtonDarkholme 
I didn't mean we should export both `Prop` and `PropType` - I think we should minimize exposing types as possible too.

But the `Prop` might be a little low level to be used in user land because we need to consider whether the props `type` is an array or not, even though we just want to focus its type parameter in that case.
So I would suggest to add a thin wrapper type to intended to be used in the user land.

@ferdaber 
I'd say `PropValidator` shouldn't be exposed since we just want to cast `type` here. It seems a little overkill for me.The only difference between `PropType<T>` (which currently does not exist in options.d.ts), and `PropValidator<T>` is the additional union of the customized object syntax of the prop validator API. If someone were to use the customized object syntax then they would still need to do something like:
```ts
props: {
  union: [Object, String] as PropType<Foo | string>,
  complexUnion: {
    type: [Object, String] as PropType<Foo | string>
    // ... other stuff
  }
}
```
versus
```ts
props: {
  union: [Object, String] as PropValidator<Foo | string>,
  complexUnion: {
    type: [Object, String]
    // ... other stuff
  } as PropValidator<Foo | string>
}
```

I guess to me it makes more sense to have the typecast be in the same level of each prop definition, but it doesn't really make much of a difference so I'm fine with whichever you all decide. The other benefit I see too would be that `PropValidator` is the more abstract definition of props in a Vue constructor, so if in the future the lower-level API changes `PropValidator` is the one that's least likely to changeI think `PropType` is more pragmatic than `Prop` and more intuitive than `PropValidator`.Great! I will modify the PR to create a new type called `PropType` and export that in place of `Prop`Does this PR solve the prop compile error: `TS2339: Property 'x' does not exist on type 'CombinedVueInstance<Vue, ...>`?

```Will this change solve this issue: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7640? Because in the TypeScript repo they've said that it works as intended: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/22471Any updates on this? Any movement on this? Keen to see it land!Do we know when this will be released?  I am sure ""when it's ready"" but just looking for a guestimate?@sodatea Do you know when this will be released?Do we know when this will be released? This very important for us.Gang -- when will this happen?!  This is causing us a major issue in our large Vue project.. it looks like everything is done and ready to go? Why isn't it merged? Why is this hanging around in limbo?@yyx990803 @ktsn @sodatea Anyone? This bug is causing unnecessary TypeScript errors in our projects.Once we finish CLI release this will be the first to be merged in core, please bear with us.@yyx990803 Huge congrats on the Vue CLI release! It's amazing.

Now you know what I'm going to ask next.. üòâ It would be awesome if this could be merged in. All over our huge codebase we just adapted to TypeScript, we've had to comment out `type: Array` on all our props.Just want to echo the question by @alexsasharegan. Will it solve that problem? Are there any workarounds?@RehanSaeed Yes there is. Check out [this](https://frontendsociety.com/using-a-typescript-interfaces-and-types-as-a-prop-type-in-vuejs-508ab3f83480) great article by @mmitchellgarcia.@yyx990803 It's been a month since your last comment. Any hope of getting this merged soon? I'm glad there's a workaround (by simply excluding `type: Array`), but it's still a nuisance to not have proper type checking for props.@ffxsam Looking forward to this as well, but is the function interface syntax not a viable workaround? Types are working for me with:
```js
type: Array as () => string[],
```@ky-is Nice trick, I'll give it a try. Thanks!Hi, I'm facing this problem as well. The code is pretty simple:
```
<script lang=""ts"">
import Vue from 'vue';
export default Vue.extend({
  props: {
    figs: Array,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      isModal: false,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    closeModal() {
      this.isModal = false;
    },
  },
});
</script>
```

I get the following error (on line `this.isModal = false`):

```
Property 'isModal' does not exist on type 'Vue'.
```

Hope we'll find a solution soon.The solution is this PR. I'm not sure what the holdup is. Is it pending review?",Should the type here be `PropType<T>`?

While this is addressing a real problem, this solution may not be worth the tradeoff. The current implementation does not take into account potential deeply nested components.

Any suggestions on how to check for the property existing?Shouldn't the `in` operator be enough? `if (key in object)`The `in` operator isn't enough, because at this point in the code, I think the value of the binding has already been evaluated. So the `binding` only has two properties, `expression` and `value`. And if the key doesn't exist in the data of the component then `binding.value` is present but the value is undefined.

I think the check needs to be further up the stack but I'm not sure where. I'll keep digging.@posva @yyx990803 I think I have a solution that works correctly. I'm not sure it's the best way to go about this, but I did a lot of digging and I couldn't figure out any other way to be able to check properties in the second-to-last object in the binding expression.@chriscasola thanks a lot for looking into this - I just made a comment here: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5932#issuecomment-334040085

I also implemented a proper warning check strategy in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/0fbad1e62bdd9f2ff2ca0a42d109face302ecd87 - but we will probably not use that.

it's this one: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/test/unit/modules/vdom/patch/hydration.spec.js#L301@callumacrae Let's keep that failing test, as it seems there are a couple possible exceptions we didn't think of before:

- Server-side rendering, where we want some starting content that will later be replaced by client-side rendering
- In-DOM template rendering, where a user may provide default content until Vue takes over@chrisvfritz I guess in both of those cases the behaviour we're warning about is exactly the desired behaviour. Maybe this is a documentation issue instead of something that should throw a warning?It depends on how much of a pain it'll be to make exceptions for those two environments. @blake-newman might be able to provide more information here.@chrisvfritz I believe those are valid cases. For the SSR we can detect this environment with https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/55816543c46e75aa53481ac95a89ff6f87a2d704/src/core/util/env.js#L37

I'm not totally sure about the 'in browser template', also if we made conditions for different enviroments, this will be very confusing for the user. IMO it should remain consistent behaviour, and we should allow default values. 

Instead of placing this as a check the docs should probably notify the user of the replacement behaviour of this directive.@blake-newman But content with `v-html` wouldn't actually act as a default value in the contexts we want to warn about, right? In string templates, that content will simply be ignored during compilation.

Adding it to the docs will only make them more complicated without really helping anyone. If you think about what `v-html` is doing, it makes sense that it would replace the content, so this is not as much an educational warning as it is a warning to catch an easy-to-make mistake (e.g. forgetting that you're using `v-html` or `v-text`).Perhaps adding a modifier to disable the warning would be the way to go - maybe `v-html.force` or `v-html.nowarn`. Users with those two specific cases can use the modifier, users who accidentally or unknowingly use both will be warned.

I guess this is a breaking change, though.I think having to declare modifiers to remove warnings, is not right. It adds a layer of additional complication, that we would also need to document. 

I do believe that this is down to the user to understand, and the warning will not add any value. Then having to add modifiers to disable is just more to learn. @blake-newman 

> I think having to declare modifiers to remove warnings, is not right. It adds a layer of additional complication, that we would also need to document.

I agree here.

> I do believe that this is down to the user to understand, and the warning will not add any value.

I disagree here. üôÇ  It's not about learning, but about making a mistake that could be easy to make. These are the facts as I understand them (please correct me if you have a different understanding):

- Unless server-side rendering or in-DOM, there is _never_ a case where an element with `v-html` should have content. That can always be considered a mistake.
- To make this warning possible, we need to be able to confirm that we are not in-DOM or SSRing.
- We can easily detect SSR with `isServerRendering()`.
- We're not sure how to easily detect in-DOM compilation.

If all of the above are true, then there _is_ value to adding the warning and the only question is whether we can feasibly detect in-DOM compilation. Does that sound right?Technically we *can* detect in-dom template, but I don't think it's worth adding the extra check for this specific warning. The point is that this behavior does not result in potential malfunctioning of the app logic, so it's largely harmless, not to mention it even has legit use in some cases. As a rule of thumb, we should only warn about things that would lead to bugs if you neglect it.",Add `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` to ensure that this will only warn in non production enviroments. Add `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` to ensure that this will only warn in non production enviroments

From comment https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5415#issuecomment-327276515
"" in 2.4 we already shipped a pure js build of vue-server-renderer, but we haven't announced it yet. It only supports the base renderer, but is decoupled from Node.js APIs""

That statement is not correct. `basic.js` still use `process.nextTick()` when recursion stack is to high.
With this PR switching to iterative version we can avoid `process.nextTick()` path.
Ideally `createBasicRenderer` should use different `write` function but currently this PR is ""Request For Comments""

Also iterative version passes all SSR tests (not only basic if we switch to full server-renderer) and helps a lot for not Node.js env (in my case Nashorn)",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6651,"['.eslintrc', 'build/config.js', 'src/server/create-basic-renderer.js', 'src/server/render-context.js', 'src/server/render.js']",,,"Thanks! This is indeed something we overlooked. The basic renderer was still a proof of concept which is why we didn't include it in the 2.4 release notes. Glad that this is noticed before we make it public :)

However, if we were to make it truly env-agnostic, the basic renderer should not be even able to access `process`, which is a Node-specific global (maybe it also exists in Nashorn, but not in every environment). The `process.env.BASIC_RENDERER` needs to be converted into constants during the compilation phase. I'll take a look at this as part of 2.5 features, but feel free to try addressing that.There isn't `process` in nashorn. I'm all for env-agnostic basic renderer.

I'll try switch from `process.env....` to constants
FYI env vars to constant replacement can be configured [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/build/config.js#L172-L174)@yyx990803 
Something like this?
Another question. How to fix flow 
```
src/server/render-context.js:64
 64:     if (__BASIC_RENDERER__ === true) {
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ identifier `__BASIC_RENDERER__`. Could not resolve name
```
looking for `__WEEX__` I can't find anything about in config filesThanks for looking into this! Instead of making the whole rendering synchronous, we can just use a platform specific deferring function instead. In c5d0fa05 I've made it preferring `process.nextTick` -> `Promise.then` -> `setTimeout`.

In php-v8js Promise is already supported; in Nashorn, you can [polyfill setTimeout](https://blogs.oracle.com/nashorn/setinterval-and-settimeout-javascript-functions) using Java timers.Just for curiosity. Is there anything wrong with synchronous approach?
In my free time I'm working on Vue SSR in pure java (core still use Nashorn) and if there are some issues with synchronous approach it is better to me know this early :)Vue's SSR is designed to be async first, because there are many operations that may be async during render:

- async components
- external cache calls
- unwinding deep call stacks

Making things sync is just fundamentally against the design.",

**Other information:**

Sometimes I minified the code without `NODE_ENV=production`, It still warned me `You are running Vue in development mode.`, I don't think it's rigorous enough.

To determine whether the code runs in the development mode or in production mode, I think it should be judged from the behavior of the code, not just from the `NODE_ENV` flag when building.

So I add `function hasCrashed () {}`, when someone minified the code without flag. But the code here will know, ""Oh, You are No Longer Development!""

Also, I find the [doc](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/deployment.html) of VUE are still using the vue.js uncompressed version. 

(‡∏á ‚Ä¢ÃÄ_‚Ä¢ÃÅ)‡∏á",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6631,['src/platforms/web/runtime/index.js'],,,"You can remove the production tip by setting an option, but as you can imagine, we cannot add that hack to check if the code is minified.
Using the non-minified version is intentional to allow using the devtools to play around in the docs

FYI, if you minify the code without `NODE_ENV=production`, you'll end up with a bigger bundleDevelopment mode simply means all the extra runtime checks and warnings are still in your bundle - even if it's minified, it is still technically in development mode. If you want to deploy for production, **you should never minify your code without `NODE_ENV=production`**. The fact that the warning is still there actually helps you discover the problem.",

",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6494,['src/shared/util.js'],,,"Hmm, I personally don't like annotating variable declarations when it is obvious enough. Flow is also smart enough to infer these cases I believe. It's more valuable to annotate function arguments because those are not immediately obvious when the definition of the function is separate from the call site.Hi @kazupon. As far as I know, [most](https://github.com/raywenderlich/kotlin-style-guide#type-inference) [languages](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/no-inferrable-types/) [prefer](https://github.com/linkedin/swift-style-guide#31-general) [inference](https://github.com/databricks/scala-style-guide#type-inference) over annotation, at declaration site.

The reasoning for inference: 
1. type is already obvious and explicit from initializer, e.g. `parseFloat`, `isObject` is very clear.
2. additional annotation is duplication. If we later want to change initializer, we have to also change annotation.
3. annotating everywhere can make reader confused. Readers might think universal annotation is code authors' quirk so no more info brought by annotation. But some annotations do have some useful information. Consider code  `let i: Context = {}; i.field = fieldInfo;` and `let i: number = 42`. The former annotation does express additional information.

There is also good advice for when to add annotation, though in scala (we can skip scala specific rule like implicit).
https://github.com/databricks/scala-style-guide#type-inference@HerringtonDarkholme 
Thank you for great explanations!
Indeed.

I seemed to have been lack of knowledge about type annotation names yet.
I close this PR.
Sorry for confusing you. üôá ","Does this affect anything?I don't think there is any problem. ü§î 
In fact it can return various types of values.

I'm using the reactive setter to set a property with the `sync` modifier. My case is that since the `sync` modifier is basically just syntactic sugar to avoid some boilerplate, it is useful for most case to set a property through `Vue.set`.

I might be wrong, but instead of opening an issue I thought doing a pull request would be faster, since the change is just a line of code.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6367,"['build/release-weex.sh', 'packages/weex-template-compiler/build.js', 'packages/weex-template-compiler/package.json', 'packages/weex-vue-framework/factory.js', 'packages/weex-vue-framework/index.js', 'packages/weex-vue-framework/package.json', 'src/core/instance/render-helpers/bind-object-props.js', 'src/core/util/env.js']",,,"Hello thanks for your PR but using `Vue.set` has an extra cost because it forces Vue to add watchers whereas doing a plain assignment don't. This is intentional, remember every reactive property should be declared in `data`Hey! Thanks for answering. I was just wondering if basically anything with `.sync` isn't practically expected to be reactive, and that would save some boilerplate.

But if you disagree, feel free to close of course :)Sync is for two way binding. You shouldn't do Vue. Set everyone to se something, it's for Vey specific cases. Look for caveat in the documentation. That would hopefully clarify many things This seems unnecessary to me, since the event listener would only be created if the key already exists in that object. This would only apply when the key exists and is not already reactive, which sounds like quite an unlikely case for `v-bind` object. Closing but feel free to provide a use case where this would prove necessary.",

**Other information:**
A lot of people ask specifically about object spread support in vue templates but it's limited to environment where compilation is happening. Since most of the time people are using babel which uses babylon as parser, we can use same parser for vue templates if available. Discussion: #6307.

Tests are not included because tests are runnnig in `PhantomJS` where `require()` is not available. Tested locally.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6328,['src/compiler/error-detector.js'],,,"Note compiler is also used in browser. So requiring babylon doesn't run at all.

If this change only applies in nodejs environment, can we just apply change in vue-loader?@HerringtonDarkholme, I am not familiar with `vue-loader` codebase. Is there a way to override expression validation only in it? If yes I think that's a better solution.I think that is doable, compiler has a `module` option to modify ast. We can transpile expression there.@HerringtonDarkholme, I don't think we want to transpile expressions, that should be handled by webpack, the only thing that affects usage of things like spread in vue expressions is the expression validation, we should only make this validation pass. Adding another layer to transpile expressions from vue templates before passing the template to template compiler itself doesn't sound good IMHO.After further consideration, I still think porting expression checking logic to vue-loader is a better solution:

1, current PR maintains two parallel expression checking logic: one is babylon in vue compiler, the other is in [vue-template-compiler](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-template-es2015-compiler). Even passing vue compiler will still causing errors in vue-template-compiler because buble, the underlying transpiler for vue-loader, does not recognize features like optional chaining and numeric separator.

2. transpiling ESNext expression can be legitimate compiler plugin's work, if viewed as [strength reduction](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Strength_reduction), that is, we reduce stronger ESNext expression to weaker ES5 expression. Indeed, compilers do have multiple transformation phase since long ago.


3. If purity does need to be kept, we can introduce a new flag like `needCheck` to skip checking in core compiler. All vue loader needs to do is checking expression before and set `needCheck` to false.

4. Core compiler is shared between node building and browsers. We cannot cram too much logic like resolving babelrc in core compiler.

5. Ideologically, a require statement in `try { } catch(e) {}` reminds me of conditional macro in C/CPP. It is targeted only for nodejs. Platform specific code in core code looks quite smelly to me. Especially we can check it via `module`.@HerringtonDarkholme, Yeah, agree, transpiling expressions in `vue-loader` sounds better, still need to figure out a wayt to do that.","I haven't used `babylon` before, so these may not be the most intelligent questions - I apologize in advance. üòÖ  

- Where do these plugins come from? Are we relying on them being installed by the user? What if one of them isn't?
- Would it be possible to read from a user's `.babelrc` file, if it exists, then simply skip this step if there is none? I worry about having two separate combinations of Babel features, one of which it may _seem_ the user is in control of, but really isn't.@chrisvfritz, plugins are a part of `babylon` and are bundled with it.

Looking for `.babelrc` synchronously in the directory tree would be very expensive and blocking. Specially if we consider that sometimes you need to go a lot of directories up to find the `.babelrc`, and we cannot do that asynchronously :(And reading from `.babelrc` and tracking down `babylon` plugins from it can be pretty hard too, I think that adds a lot of complexity, we can add optional `BABYLON_PLUGINS` env variable support, something like: 
```
> BABYLON_PLUGINS=objectRestSpread,numericSeparator npm run dev
```
What do you think?@nickmessing Hmm, I don't have any ideas either for easily mapping Babel configs to babylon plugins, making the feasability of reading from `.babelrc` kind of moot anyway. üòï  Having taken a closer look at babylon now, I agree with the subset of plugins you've chosen to include and I didn't realize before that it supported ES2017 out-of-the-box. üëç @nickmessing Regarding the environment variable, I think it'd just be good to include any plugins that could possibly be needed in a template expression - which I think you've already done. I think it's better to allow _too much_ than too little here. If they're using a syntax that _really_ isn't supported by the user's own Babel config, they'll still see an error, just a syntax error as they would (probably) expect, rather than an invalid template error."

I brought this up in #6216 a couple weeks ago and it didn't encounter any opposition, so here we go! 

__TLDR__: Since `v-bind=""$attrs""` and `v-on=""$listeners""` were added, a lot of people have been assuming that combining these should be sufficient to allow `v-model` on the component. This PR makes `v-model` work as users expect.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6327,"['build/release-weex.sh', 'packages/weex-template-compiler/build.js', 'packages/weex-template-compiler/package.json', 'packages/weex-vue-framework/factory.js', 'packages/weex-vue-framework/index.js', 'packages/weex-vue-framework/package.json', 'src/compiler/directives/model.js', 'src/core/vdom/create-component.js', 'test/unit/features/directives/model-component.spec.js', 'test/weex/compiler/v-model.spec.js', 'test/weex/runtime/events.spec.js']",,,"I just noticed some Weex tests are failing. I could easily make them pass, but due to the nature of the tests and my own lack of experience with Weex, I'm not confident this would actually guarantee working behavior. 

@Jinjiang Would you mind taking a look? Is it safe to update the tests, or is it possible my changes would break Weex?Seems `$event.target.value` will break weex, browser-based code shouldn't exist in cross-platform part.@javoski Are you sure this would break Weex? I only try to access `$event.target.value` if the `$event` is an object and `$event.type === 'input'`. In cases where a DOM Event (or something resembling a DOM Event) isn't attached to the component event (which I think should always be the case in native environments), Weex would not see changed behavior.@chrisvfritz sorry it's still loading status in ""$ bash build/ci.sh"" part of the ci report (maybe my network problem). I will have a look in the deep. Just a moment please :-)@chrisvfritz This commit is fine. Currently you can just skip these failed test cases in weex. And @Hanks10100 and I will fix them later.
Thanks.@chrisvfritz After I confirmed that this feature will not destroy weex, I will modify those failed test cases and add the corresponding case in Weex.@chrisvfritz  I fixed the test case in Weex and send a PR (https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue/pull/1) to your branch. The CI is passed.

Your modification didn't break Weex, but not consider the difference of it.

As I write in that PR:

> In Weex, the structure of the `<input>` element has a slight difference with Web, it doesn't have the `value` property but has `attr.value`.Can this be merged? It would be a great help for wrapping inputs!See https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6216#issuecomment-333648093Yeah, I agree it felt a little hacky and certainly didn't cover every use case. Part of me was hoping you'd think of some small refactor that would simplify things, but we weren't lucky this time. üôÇ ",

However, there is no silver bullet for server side vue template, especially when users want to mix user generated content with programmer's template. IMHO, Vue's users can and should think over how to separate UGC and template.

On the other hand, Vue's API is already large enough. `Vue.config.interpolation` can be easily replaced by `v-pre` that already exists. Users can even provide non-matching regex to mock this pull request. 

While we thank your contribution, we might still keep our API surface not too large. (Vue's API is already not as small as it used to be). For more reasoning, please see https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6004#issuecomment-312404196.@HerringtonDarkholme 
Tanks for reply.

I see.
I also agree with a policy of minimum API.

But, the non-matching regex is weak to version up, because it's implemented by a mocking replace method of string.
(please see https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4223#issuecomment-272113467 about `v-pre` )

So, I created plugin.

fix [https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6093](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6093)

`Object.create` is not adding 'own property' to the object, which caused injections not injected properly.üò≠",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6098,"['src/core/util/options.js', 'test/unit/features/options/inject.spec.js']",,,"Thanks for the PR.
Actually there's no need to add another merge strategy function, it's an issue about using `Object.keys()` to iterate inject object while using `for...in` on other options. (`Object.keys()` will not enumerates properties in the prototype chain, but `for...in` does). 
See [https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/instance/inject.js#L21](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/instance/inject.js#L21)

So my suggestion is:
```js
strats.props =
strats.methods =
strats.inject =
strats.computed = function (parentVal: ?Object, childVal: ?Object): ?Object {
  if (!parentVal) return childVal
  const ret = Object.create(null)
  extend(ret, parentVal)
  if (childVal) extend(ret, childVal)
  return ret
}
```

```js
// Just delete this line will fix that issue :
if (!childVal) return Object.create(parentVal || null)
```@javoski You are right, I did think about that too. But I just didn't have the confident to remove that line directly. (I was afraid it's using `Object.create` for a reason)

Anyway, If it works totally OK without `Object.create`, it's better to merge your PR, and feel free to close this one when merging it.Thanks, #6093 seems to be a simpler fix.",

CircleCI 2.0 allows for faster performance and reduced overall time to build and test by utilizing parallel testing via workflows. The codebase and dependencies are downloaded, cached, and are then used as part of a common workspace for the different components in `npm run test`, which have been split into four parallel containers.

Tests should complete in around 1m45s once the initial testing and caching has been done with CircleCI 2.0, compared to around 4m currently.
",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6041,['.circleci/config.yml'],,,"Thanks for PR, but why is the v2 config file so much more complex? What's the advantage of this over the current shell script?Hi, thanks for reviewing!

Circle's v2 provides much more customization over v1, and as such requires a lengthier configuration file. The v2 config file in the PR pulls the code, restores and updates the dependency cache, and provides this environment as a common workspace in separate containers for the different types of testing that were present in `npm run test`. The different tests run in parallel now instead of sequentially, cutting the time to build and test by almost half compared to the v1 config.Isn't there a simpler syntax for that. 130 lines of yml config looks like an overkill üò≠ 
edit: don't get me wrong, cutting the time of build by 50% is amazing, but people actually need to learn too much before being able to edit that fileUnfortunately no, I did the best I could by using references at the top of the yml to avoid repeating many of the lines. I'd be happy to go back in and comment all the things so people can follow along and contribute more easily in the future if that sounds good!Personally, I think this can save quite some time. Having comments do help.
As a CircleCI user, v2 looked super interesting but when I wanted to use it, I was overwhelmed by how complicated it was compared to v1 (can work with zero config). It's clear how powerful it is in complex projects. Having you writing a config for vue makes it much easier understand how it works üôÇ I played with this in the CI branch and indeed it greatly speeds up the build, but the base Node image in CircleCI 2 doesn't have java so the Selenium-based e2e tests cannot be run. If anyone wants to take this over and find a suitable docker image to use, contributions are welcome.@heug thanks again for the PR! We have enabled CircleCI 2 in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6627 :)",

[size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) is a tool to show how many kilobytes your JS library increases the user bundle. You can set size budget and size-limit will prevent JavaScript libraries bloat on Travis CI.

It already used in Autoprefixer, PostCSS and JSS. For instance, I reduce Logux Client size 2x because I found some unexpected huge dependencies.

For Vue this tool can be useful to always know project size and prevent unexpected size regression.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/6015,"['dist/vue.min.js', 'package.json', 'yarn.lock']",,,"Thanks for the pr Andrey üôÇ 
I'm not sure this is useful for Vue because it doesn't have any dependency and also because we use rollup for bundling. The tools looks interesting, really like the fact that you added a way to run the bundle analyzer

edit: The question I ask myself if it is going to break at least one. Otherwise it may not be worth the extra CI time (which I haven't checked)@posva yeap, tool is much effective in project with dependencies :D.

But even without dependencies some wrong `process` usage could increase bundle size for few KB.

Anyway, Vue is already small, so it is up to you, to lint bundle size or not :)@posva BTW, React is planning to add this kind of tool too https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/10090

But since you have no dependencies and already build-in file, maybe `bundlesize` by @siddharthkp will be better for you. It doesn‚Äôt run webpack, so results is not so accurate, but in other hand tool works faster.@ai I see, yeah, bundlesize may be useful since it checks a generated file but lets you generate it as you wantHey thanks for the PR @ai - in fact, Vue's build script already logs the size for every dist file when they are built, and we don't have any dependencies, so I believe an extra tool is unnecessary.",

Also, just the presence of `scope` is ambiguous - e.g. you may want to bind a prop named `scope` on a component.I agree that we should make it more explicit.

",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5993,"['src/shared/util.js', 'test/unit/modules/shared/key-sort.spec.js']",,,"This maybe not working because AFAIK it's `JSON.stringify` that has no guarantee on the order of properties serialized by it. Will it be useful by sorting the keys before serializing? ü§îDefinitely a somewhat trivial edge case. There are two ways to ensure this AFAIK. This approach has some reusability or you can pass sorted keys to stringify ```JSON.stringify(obj, Object.keys(obj).sort())```@drewsmith Is this right approach?

If I compare key by key in two objects, it would take `O(N)` comparisons.
If I sort then compare stringified JSON, it would take `O(N logN)` comparisons + overhead of `stringify`.@znck Thanks for the comment. Are you referring to passing sorted keys to ```stringify``` or sorting altogether?

The _right_ approach is deep object equality IMO, which ```stringify``` is a low tech mechanism for doing so since it serializes the entire object including values. The fact the order is not deterministic requires some sort of explicit ordering or perhaps ```stringify``` should be replaced with something else altogether?I want to say, sorting the keys beats the purpose of `looseEqual`.

Also, `looseEqual` is used only in [model.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/master/src/platforms/web/runtime/directives/model.js) for select options, I guess `stringify` serves the purpose there. @yyx990803 would know this better.I agree with you depending on semantics. Does loose mean implicit deep copy, or is it a synonym for shallow? ```stringify``` gets you a poor man's deep copy, but either way values need to be compared.Maybe check how [this package does it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-stable-stringify).Thanks for the PR - however, cloning with sorted keys results in extra memory allocation and it's better to just compare in place. See a8ac129","Either one should be `unsortedTestObj` here.If `obj` isn't `object`, this function always return an empty object which makes such call like `looseEqual(1, 2)` returning `true`.This only sorts the first level of an object. For nested object like `{nested: {a: 1, b: 2}}` and `{nested: {b:2, a:1}}`, it fails.

A recursive call should pay more attention to cyclic references.This function is only used in this file, consider not exporting it. Also, obj is annotated as `any` which in this case, `Object` is a better choice, if you perform no recursive call.This changes `looseEqual`'s original behavior."

When binding a value using array or object syntax, it is much more human readable and human writable to allow white space within it. This PR makes a change to the 5th capture group of the HTML parser regex to not break the match when a white space appears, thus allowing you to have spaces in your array/object syntax.

For example, if you have a template like one of these:
```js
template: `<p :class=[color, decoration]>{{message}}</p>`,
//or
template: `<p :class={enabled: isEnabled, error: hasError}>{{message}}</p>`
```
The current parser will throw a template compilation error `- invalid expression: :class=""[color,""`. [Here is a simple jsfiddle showing the issue](https://jsfiddle.net/jimrottinger/50wL7mdz/40869/). The changes in this PR correctly grabs the entire array or object, white spaces included.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5904,"['src/compiler/parser/html-parser.js', 'test/unit/modules/compiler/parser.spec.js']",,,"Hmm, I don't think this is a good idea - this makes the template invalid HTML, thus breaking compat with other HTML-based tooling. Thanks for the PR though!",these lines were throwing `Expected indentation of 6 spaces but found 8 indent` when I tried to commit my changes.
DanielRosenwasser,5887,,Improve Vue type declarations for more canonical usage,closed,2017-06-14,"This PR improves the Vue `.d.ts` files so that users can get some improved inference when using the `noImplicitThis` compiler option. It takes advantage of many of the features the TypeScript team has been working on over the last few versions. Thus, it requires a minimum TypeScript version of 2.4. You can get this working with the current `typescript@next` (which is `2.5.0-dev.20170614`, but don't let that version number fool you - this will work with the final release of 2.4).

The best part about this change is that it makes using Vue easier when users choose not to use classes and inheritance. In other words, users and can more easily `new` up an instance using the Vue constructor, and can create components using the `Vue.extend` and `Vue.component` APIs a little more naturally. Extending Vue as a class will still work, so if you prefer to use vue-class-component and the rest, that should still work! However, those dependencies may need to be updated for this change.

There's definitely some amount of complexity that's been introduced but I'm willing to iterate on this with the help of others. Given the feedback that we've heard on [TypeScript-Vue-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Vue-Starter), it's been a positive experience for users.

Fixes many of the issues users have asked about in #478.

Tests are probably failing at this point because I need to update the project's dependency on TypeScript.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5887,"['build/release-weex.sh', 'package.json', 'packages/weex-template-compiler/build.js', 'packages/weex-template-compiler/package.json', 'packages/weex-vue-framework/factory.js', 'packages/weex-vue-framework/index.js', 'packages/weex-vue-framework/package.json', 'types/index.d.ts', 'types/options.d.ts', 'types/test/augmentation-test.ts', 'types/test/options-test.ts', 'types/test/plugin-test.ts', 'types/test/tsconfig.json', 'types/test/vue-test.ts', 'types/tsconfig.json', 'types/vue.d.ts', 'yarn.lock']",,,"Thanks @DanielRosenwasser ! Are there any remaining incompatibilities aside from the need for using latest dependancies, e.g. required change in `tsconfig`?

Also this would cover #5016 as far as I can tell.hmmm, the test is failing. 

It seems ` Base constructor return type 'CombinedVueInstance<Data, Methods, Computed, Record<PropNames, any>>' is not a class or interface type.`. 

So interface augmentation fails.@yyx990803 the fact that `ComponentOptions` used to be generic on 1 type arg, and now has 4 unrelated type arguments, will cause some incompatibilities. That's the main one you'll run into with vue-class-component.The build should now be fixed.I just sent out a fix. In the previous iteration, `extend` inherited members on the static side instead of the instance side. I've now done the opposite. Give it another go - I've added the test that @ktsn mentioned above.@yyx990803 I think I could undo the commit if you don't want to fix #5016 right away.> Do you have any suggestion for library author to test compiling error?

We have [dtslint](https://github.com/Microsoft/dtslint#write-tests) which has a testing facility to `$ExpectType` and `$ExpectError`. I could add some error tests there if you'd like. What did you have in mind?@DanielRosenwasser Thanks for sharing dtslint! Definitely I will try to add it to Vue.

Since this pull request is already big, IMHO it is fine to separate dtslint to another PR.@ktsn @HerringtonDarkholme seeing that both of you have approved this, I think the next step should be working out an upgrade guide - i.e. what would be different from the [current recommendation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/typescript.html).

@ktsn Does `vue-class-component` need to be upgraded to be compatible with the new types?@yyx990803 I think we need to update `vue-class-component` since it uses `ComponentOptions` in its declarations.

`vue-router` and `vuex` need to be updated too as they augment the `ComponentOptions` type.Ok - I think I'll hold this off until:

1. TS 2.4 is out
2. `vue-class-component` has been updated.

This most likely means we will ship Vue 2.4 without the new types.Okay, lemme put this out there, as I believe this is the correct thread for what I'm dealing with. 

Right now, a basic reproduction of the Vue Getting Started doesn't work in TypeScript. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/333022/27256166-596a3aea-537b-11e7-85c9-9d9fd4afa362.png)

The only way to make that code work is to import Vue (I'm using this PR's definitions)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/333022/27256187-d81471bc-537b-11e7-9c3c-b0b809ff4b52.png)

However, it doesn't appear that modules are a requirement for Vue, given I can do this in a basic HTML file: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/333022/27256221-7e6099d8-537c-11e7-8b5d-de4773fa457e.png)

We're a bit behind the times in some of our projects, though we do use TS. We just don't use modules. `import`ing Vue forces TS to think we're using modules, and that breaks a lot of our existing code. 

Are the definitions at fault here, or my general lack of understanding otherwise? 

If it's the definitions, maybe that's something you can take into consideration. @alexdresko
https://forum.vuejs.org/t/typescript-is-there-a-type-definition-for-vue2-and-how-to-use-it/1741/7?u=ktsn@alexdresko what would be ideal is a UMD-style declaration (`export as namespace Vue`), however, currently we can only say that `Vue` has the shape of `index.ts`, not that it has the shape of the Vue default export. CC @RyanCavanaugh.Didn't realize we could just conjure up @RyanCavanaugh from anywhere. Cool. Do we have to @ him three times for it to work? 

Also, for anyone who shows up here later, here's what the new code would look like if you hack this PR into your workspace with the suggestion from @ktsn.... on my machine, in VS Code (which is sometimes TS-phobic)

```
import * as _Vue from ""vue"";

declare global {
  const Vue: typeof _Vue.default
}
```

Or, at least, that's how I was able to get it to work. There may be other, better ways. Once merged, will this allow us to type the props also i.e. props implementing an interface? Run time checking would be nice, but I am more interested in the code completion, compile error etc the ide will provide once the props are typed.@prashantkhurana unfortunately not, but I can try to revisit this. You'll at least have TypeScript aware of your `props` though.thanks @DanielRosenwasser . yeah that would be the icing on the cake:) Hi.

I just wondered how to add Dom references to `$refs`.
Current definitions allow us to write like this, but the future version won't allow to do so.

```ts
interface App extends Vue {
  $refs: {
    target: HTMLElement
  }
}

export default {
  created() {
    this.$refs.target
  }
} as ComponentOptions<App>
```

If many people doesn't care about this, I think there's no need to fix this PR, but if somebody takes care about this, it should be done so.
For me, I haven't written like this yet, so I don't care about it...
How do you think about this?@kaorun343 I have come up with this: 

Rather than keeping `ComponentOption` as an `interface`, making it a `type` alias seems better choice. With the aid of default generic argument, we can even reduce the impact of breaking change.

Example:

```ts
type ComponentOption<Vue, D={}, M={}, C={}, P={}> = InternalOption<D,M,C,P> & ThisType<D&M&C&P&Vue>

interface InternalOption<Data, Methods, Computed, Props> {
    methods?: Methods
}

interface App {
    $refs: {
        target: HTMLInputElement
    }
}

var a: ComponentOption<App> = { // no breaking change
    methods: {
        test() {
            this.$refs.target
        }
    }
}

interface MyComponentOption extends ComponentOption<App, {foo: number}> { // refine more
}
```

@DanielRosenwasser  what's your opinion?

It seems without https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14400 optional generic type inference, users will have to annotate more.One major issue is typed prop declaration:

```ts
var a = new Vue({
    props: {
        someProp: {
            type: String
        }
    },
    methods: {
        test() {
            this.someProp.toLowerCase() // error
        }
    }
})
```

Another issue is still how to refine `$refs`, `$el` and friends. Ideally, if we can support such usage

```ts
interface App {
    $refs: {
        target: HTMLInputElement
    }
}

new Vue<App>({  // we only provide the first type argument, other type arguments are inferred.
  methods: {
     setVal() {
       this.$refs.target.value = this.someProp
    }
   },
  props: ['someProp']
})
```
However, such API requires optional generic type inference as suggested in https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14400

For now, we can still roll out own helper function to refine specific fields which uses ` ThisTypedComponentOptionsWithRecordProps`
@HerringtonDarkholme  I have been thinking about prop typing a bit. One (not so elegant maybe, but quick) way to do prop typing is inferring the types from the default value of the prop.

Another is to from the type field but that required me to do ugly casting.

What's the status with this ? 

I pulled it locally, and tried it out in my project, and everything seems to work pretty well. Almost negates the need of `vue-class-component` @HerringtonDarkholme the problem with your suggestion is that it still breaks people who've done module augmentations (because you're moving from an interface to a type alias) but I think that would potentially be okay. It's just something to keep in mind.

Would it be okay to pull this in and then revisit that change instead? It might be easier for the core team to gauge the impact of that.@DanielRosenwasser  Indeed.

After several trials, I think changing to `interface ComponentOptions<V, D=any, M=any, C=any, P=any>` might introduce fewer upgrading issues.@HerringtonDarkholme @DanielRosenwasser Anything that still needs to be done, can i help out with anything?@blake-newman I think this pull request needs update dependency and tweak `Props` option type.

@HerringtonDarkholme that's not actually necessary. When a method needs its `this `type, it will walk up each contextually typed object literal until it finds one that had a contextual type consisting of `ThisType`. If it does, it uses it. If not, it uses the innermost object literal's contextual type, and if there isn't one it just uses the type of the containing literal.

You should definitely try it out!Tried it locally. It works like charm!

Sorry for the wrong reporting. ~~I only tried `accurateVueType` in vetur, which seems to wrongly configured. I will investigate more in vetur.~~

Vetur's issue is caused by `ComponentOption`'s type arg.As `ExtendedVue` is a sub-class of the Vue constructor, we can expect the constructor signature would only receive one argument like below?

```ts
new (options: any) => CombinedVueInstance<Data, Methods, Computed, Props>
```

Not sure whether we could annotate the `options` with `ThisTypedComponentOptionsWithArrayProps` etc. since the type declaration might be so complicated üòÇ In the following code, `this` type in `Child` component options does not seem to have parent's properties while the `new`ed `Child` component has it.

```ts
const Parent = Vue.extend({
  data () {
    return { parent: 'Hello' }
  }
})

const Child = Parent.extend({
  methods: {
    foo () {
      this.parent // Compile error
    }
  }
})

const child = new Child()
child.parent // No error
```

But I'm not sure how we can solve this. It may need more type parameters to extract the parent instance types into `ThisType` of the child component options....> As ExtendedVue is a sub-class of the Vue constructor, we can expect the constructor signature would only receive one argument like below?

@ktsn ExtendedVue creates an intersection with the mixin constructor `(new (...args: any[]) => CombinedVueInstance<Data, Methods, Computed, Props>)`. This means it just absorbs the argument types of the `Constructor` type that's given. See https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/13743 for more detailsGood catch! I think I can fix this, but I'll have to look into it later today.Oh, I didn't understand about the mixin constructor correctly. Thank you for the explanation.Do we have any chance to infer `Prop` type from `Constructor`? Something like the reverse of `emitDecoratorMetadata`Can we re-export `ThisTyped` option in index? It is useful for library authors, I think.We can also make Vue generic so `$data` and `$props` can be typed. But I wonder if it is an overkill.`mixin` does not have `ThisTyped` as `component` or `extend`, is this intended?üëç  for only exposing prop!I agree! To be honest this was more a limitation of the type system but it honestly seemed like more of a feature than a bug. üòÑ I originally tried to do that but the more I thought about it, the more time I realized it'd take to finish. I figured it'd be better to put the PR out and try that at a later stage.I originally made it generic but ran into problems.

Namely, `VueConstructor` has two construct signatures. Each of those signatures has two different sets of type parameters. They each constructed, at least in part, a Vue<Data, Methods, Computed, Props>`,  but each gave different type arguments. 

When extending a `Vue<Data, Methods, Computed, Props>, TypeScript tries to find the right construct signature, but it can't because it's not really possible to make a meaningful set of type arguments for `Vue` that would create the same output type for both signatures.

What it comes down to is that TypeScript has always had an assumption that the type parameters of a construct signature have had a direct correlation with the type parameters of the constructed type - but that's not entirely the case here. At least, that's my understanding of the problem.

So I could try to address this, but maybe down the line. Plus, does anyone need to access `$data` and `$props` outside of debugging?This is intended - I don't think `ThisType` would help the common scenarios, and I think don't think we can model the scenario all that well. For example, I don't think ""get the type of all the `methods` from each mixin and intersect them` is possible at the moment.Is that a great idea? Does re-exporting mean that this is committed to as part of the public interface?Thanks for the detailed explanation!

Indeed, `$data` and `$props` are mainly for advanced usage like delegate / wrapper component ([example](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4571)). We would like to check template code in future. So a `$props` or `$data` might be helpful. 

For ordinary users, `Record` should be enough.Also, should I just rename this to `ComponentOptionsWithArrayProps`?Here `Props` should be `Record<keyof Props, any>`, right?Shouldn't it be depending on a stable version?It depended on some experimental changes but afaik they landed in 2.4, didn't they @DanielRosenwasser?"

Allowing computed properties to be dynamic makes the component's behavior more unpredictable and harder to properly type-check / be statically analyzed. This is not something we'd like to encourage.

Regarding the implementation - not sure if it's a good idea to pollute the observed objects like this. Ideally we should `Object.defineProperty` to make it non-enumerable. But this operation is quite expensive.

One way to work around this might be using native `Map` when it is available, and fallback to the ""secret non-enumerable key"" strategy used in this PR. However, I'd like to do some more performance benchmarking before actually adding the changes.Adding a warning should be a better idea before native map object can be take into consideration.",Looks like a risk of memory leak hereüòÇ

#5624",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5690,"['src/server/create-renderer.js', 'src/server/template-renderer/index.js', 'test/ssr/ssr-template.spec.js']",,,"I don't think should introduce this since it come with barely benefit.Thanks for the PR, but I don't really think this is particularly useful. I'd rather have templates in all Vue SSR projects be consistent.Why not? What if we only need SSR for some specific urls, what means we need a temple for non-ssr requests. For now we must create two temples, or replace `<div id=""app""></div>` to SSR default contentPlaceholder.

And also, there is an option of contentPlaceholder before 2.3.0, so it actually breaks some use cases which is not mentioned in SSR guide.@JounQin not sure if I understand your use case - you mean you want to set the placeholder to something else so that the route does not SSR?

The previous option was in a separate package so technically it was not under Vue's version constraints.Yes, we shared same template for SSR and non-SSR requests before (our placeholder is `<div id=""app""></app>` which is a valid root for non-SSR requests).

To developers, we're just migrating from one solution to another, and they share most of developing experience except `contentPlaceholder` option, so maybe it will be better if it's mentioned in document.Ah, that's actually clever. Although I kinda feel it's not the use case this option should be designed for. You can easily use the same template file and do this when creating the renderer:

``` js
const renderer = createBundleRenderer({
   // ...
   template: template.replace('<div id=""app""></div>', '<!--vue-ssr-outlet-->')
})

in issue #5618 , then VNode in the first layer of the array don't get a key when father component call `normalizeChildren`,
but get a key when child component call `normalizeChildren`.

this leads to a changeable key, and component was re-created.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5622,['src/core/vdom/helpers/normalize-children.js'],,,"test still failed, I am try to find the reason.@pengchongfu 

You can compile the code, and then copy the test case to the console debugging@gebilaoxiong , thanks. 

- My change seems to introduce a bug : (. I hava test locally and found this [test](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/test/unit/modules/vdom/patch/edge-cases.spec.js#L61) failed.

- I make a [demo](https://jsfiddle.net/6zvyzzsh/), I know it is a little hack. `compVm._watcher` was inactive, I am try to find the reason.

my fault, `compVm._watcher` changed. see this [demo](https://jsfiddle.net/6zvyzzsh/1/)@yyx990803 , my change would introduce new bug :(, because if we force every VNode has a key by order, this will have side effect for patch, see this [demo](https://jsfiddle.net/6zvyzzsh/2/).

I have update my change, maybe we should filter the VNode before set a key.
only set a key to VNode have similar shape, likely generated by v-for.hi, I looked at your code

there is a problem about the nested child as a `v-for` created 

``` html
<div id=""app""></div>
```

``` javascript
const vm = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: { n: 1 },
  render(h) {
    const list = []

    for (let i = 0; i < this.n; i++) {
      list.push(h('input', {
        attrs: {
          value: 'a',
          type: 'text'
        }
      }))
    }

    const b = h('input', {
      attrs: {
        value: 'b',
        type: 'text'
      }
    })
    
    return h('div', [
      [...list, b]
    ])
  }
})
```

If the nested list is followed by the same type of element...

### steps to reproduce

Enter some data in the last input box

modify the value of `n` in the console :

```javascript
vm.n++
```

### What is expected

it will create a new input, and the value of this input is b

### What is actually happening?

But the correct should be create a element In front of `b`

### Conclusion
It is always problematic to distinguish whether the element is a loop

So I think here should only set the key for `v-for` created, or should remove this [code](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/vdom/helpers/normalize-children.js#L61)

to avoid other situations
@gebilaoxiong , you are right, the best way is coding carefully...","I think here only need to determine whether `c` is created by `slot`, avoid to set `key `Let me fix it üôÇ "

IE 10 was throwing `Invalid Arguments` in this function call. I never used the function directly so somewhere down the line something was receiving a variable of the wrong type (at least by IE 10 standards).
Hey, please undo the `dist/` folder changes and space before function parentheses and add space after `catch`@nickmessing Will do.

Also, after more testing this didn't totally fix my issue. Thinking of making this fallback to innerText on IE11. Any qualms about this?@mini-eggs, I don't know why you have issues since `node.textContent=` setter is available in IE9+. I didn't use windows for the last 4 years so I'm not sure I can help you with that, I suggest you check the browser market share and make sure you need IE9-10 support, if you do then try to debug exactly why `node.textContent=` doesn't work.Do you have a minimal repro of the original issue?I do not, it's a large private codebase. After a better look into the issue this morning I'm convinced this is not an issue with Vue.

We use the lib countUp.js within our Vue templates. Both Vue and countUp were changing the node where this occurred at the same time. Creating a computed variable in the Vue instance fixed the issue.Ok! No worries. Thanks for the pr though ‚ò∫Ô∏è
It's pretty cool you decided to directly do the pr but it's better if you
provide a repro at the same time since no issue exist. You can even do it
in two steps if you prefer: create the issue and immediately after the pr

Here is a part of the template which will be rendered both in client-side and server-side:
```
<div v-for=""i in 3"" v-if=""0===i"" :is=""tabs[i].type"" v-bind=""tabs[i].data""></div>
```
In Vue 2.3.0, it was rendered to two VNodes: `[component, text]`, while the server-side only rendered the first node. 

The case will lead to this error: `The client-side rendered virtual DOM tree is not matching server-rendered content.`

The problem is, by method `normalizeArrayChildren`, `[component, comment, comment]` will be processed into ` [component] -> [component, comment] ->  [component, text]`.

Fixes the issue described in [babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx#74](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx/issues/74)",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5534,"['src/core/vdom/create-functional-component.js', 'test/unit/features/options/functional.spec.js']",,,"~Hey, the issue link is broken, can you get a working link please?~
https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx/issues/74The implementation looks good. 

It feels strange for me to inject `_context` to a `this`-less functional component, though.
https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html#Functional-Components

@HerringtonDarkholme, I am not sure why but we do have a unique context for each functional component anyway, and this change won't break anything. I actually think that if we have to have a context why not have a common context shared between all functional components since it's going to be ""empty"". @yyx990803, can you please share your opinion on that?Hmm, indeed having `this` in a functional render fn feels weird. I think injecting this could be a bit surprising if users accidentally use it.

Since users have to use the `context` in most cases when using functional components, they have to provide `h` as the first argument anyway :/

Maybe instead - if the function name is `render` and have no arguments, we inject the `h` argument automatically?@yyx990803, I think that should be discussed in an issue in the babel-plugin-transform-jsx itself.I get the same issue
`Cannot read property '$createElement' of undefined`

for some reason, `render` is injected to the component@Gcaufy, can you please create an issue in vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx with all the information?This occurred to me today and seems like having a method called `render()` inside the `methods` property will cause this error.",

Kinda like to detect if someone overwrite the Vue instance.
And if really really needs, should be only in development mode.@dsonet  thanks for you reply.

What I do is avoid overwriting the built-in directives

doc: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/custom-directive.html#Intro

> In addition to the default set of directives shipped in core (v-model and v-show), Vue also allows you to register your own custom directives

Like `checkComponent()`, I was checking in development mode

``` javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  checkComponents(child)
  checkDirectives(parent.directives, child.directives)
}
```

üòÉ Hmm thanks for the PR - bt this doesn't seem to detect cases where user attempts to register other built-ins e.g. `v-if` (which would just fail silently).

After thinking about it, it seems the only way would be to have a constant list of built-ins for each platform. Feels too much of an edge case for this extra maintenance burden.

Still, thank you for the effort put into this PR!Yes, it is also bothering me, in addition also need to distinguish between compile-time and runtime",

gebilaoxiong,5285,,support `for with` in template,closed,2017-03-25,issue: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5269,https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/5285,"['flow/compiler.js', 'src/compiler/codegen/index.js', 'src/compiler/parser/index.js', 'test/unit/features/directives/for.spec.js']",,,"Hey, thanks for doing this. One observation:

```js
  it('render with scope', () => {
    const vm = new Vue({
      data: {
        pos: [0, 2],
        list: ['a', 'b', 'c']
      },
      template: `
        <ul>
          <li v-for=""i in pos"" with=""list"">{{list[i]}}</li>
        </ul>
      `
    }).$mount()
    expect(vm.$el.textContent).toMatch('ac')
  })
```
That looks the same as:
```js
  it('render with scope', () => {
    const vm = new Vue({
      data: {
        pos: [0, 2],
        list: ['a', 'b', 'c']
      },
      template: `
        <ul>
          <li v-for=""i in pos"">{{list[i]}}</li>
        </ul>
      `
    }).$mount()
    expect(vm.$el.textContent).toMatch('ac')
  })

```
Only difference is the omission of `with`. The idea, really, is for `with` to provide something that is computed and doesn't currently exist on the vm and is relevant/based on the current iterated element in the list.@rhyek Sorry, my unit tests are not rigorous enoughThanks for your contribution.

But I'm afraid this breaks vue-loader. Vue loader will `stripWith` in production build to get rid of `with` syntax. 

Now it is done by prefixing `vm` to properties used in template, because almost every name in template can be found on Vue instance. 

However, this pull request breaks the assumption. And there is no easy way to tell where a name come from, scope or vm?imo It's better not to add more efforts to this feature yet, because atm we're not likely to add it@posva  Okay, I turned it off

@HerringtonDarkholme thank you for your reply@gebilaoxiong, and `use strict` doesn't allow `with` :(@nickmessing Perhaps we can add a prefix to avoid this problem, link `{{$scope.person.xxx}}`, but not important. **HerringtonDarkholme** is right.",

i have try resolveAsset parentComponent.$options here if context is transition-group
but this is not a good idea
If this only works for global components it's not really a complete fix. Currently the user can actually do

``` html
<transition-group :tag=""$options.components.foo"">
```

It renders correctly, but there will be patch errors on updates. I think there are thing that needs to be further debugged inside transition-group itself before we can tackle this request properly, but it's not really high priority at the moment.","Use a local component here so that it doesn't accidentally pollute other test cases.That is a problem. `<component>` is resolved in `<transition-group>`, if I register it in `App` it won't be available in `<transition-group>`.

When an item is appended to the end of a list being rendered using v-for, it is appended as a new child to the parent element. If an element has been appended after the list in the meantime, it will appear in the middle of this list instead of after.

It's simply impossible to cater to every possible case - for example, your patch only works when there is a single element appended, what if there are multiple ones appended? The code would have to bloat significantly to cater to all these cases and imo simply not practical nor worth it.Thanks for the reply - the patch does work regardless of the number of elements externally appended as it uses the elm from the vdom as the reference, but makes sense that the patching algorithm shouldn't be expected to deal with external mutations - noted!",

I'm reporting my experience with integrating Flow with Vue. But I think this might be helpful to you.

> (Flow) definition files don't give good development experimence to users

Providing good typing experience would be very hard in flow. Mainly due to flow's inherent expressiveness:

this-type: https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/452
library augmentation: https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/396

Without this -type, we cannot define Vue's methods/data option. Without augmentation, we cannot extend Vue's option object (which is a practice quite common in Vue community). These two are simply deal breakers.

Arguably TypeScript definition file does not provide decent experience (for now, will be better after TS2.3). But TS definition serves as a basic ground for library authors like vue-class-component.

Sadly, class component like approach utilizes stage-1 decorator syntax, which flow just [ignores now](https://flowtype.org/docs/advanced-configuration.html#_). This simply means flow-definition isn't needed. üòû 

Other typing approach like [chain-api](https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme/vivio#component) isn't doable in flow due to this-typing problem stated above. 

Generally I would dare to say Flow is (naturally) React biased. It is very hard to integrate other frameworks with it...@HerringtonDarkholme 
Thank you for your advise!

When I'm implementing flow type definition of vue, I encountered to it.
In flow version, I feel so difficulty.
Flow and Vue API not are very compatible.  üòû
In this reason, I'll pend this PR once.@kazupon @HerringtonDarkholme, hello. I'm kinda confused on this topic. I'm seeing some flowtype defs in `/flow` directory of the vue (as well as vue-router) project. But in the mean time this PR is pended. What's the status of current definitions?@StreetStrider 
Sorry to confuse you. üôá 

Vue core or Vue official plugins have some flowtype definitions, But these are for internal developement. in this reason, I'll try to improve, As I have mentioned in the above, I have encountered difficulties.@StreetStrider The definitions in the `/flow` directory of the vue and vue-router repositories are used during delevopment of those libraries - they offer typings of the internal APIs, and are not suited to be used by the users of those libraries because the public APIs are not sufficiently typed as of now.

As @HerringtonDarkholme explained, that is hard to do currently, without a possibilty to  type `this` in Flow.I see. ü§î  the main obstacle is Flow does not allow determine `this` type as a part of function signature and Vue rely (heavily) on it. Why not just omit it? The rest of the signature will be under type control. This isn't ideal typedef but it is better than nothing at all.

In light of `this` extensively used in Vue architecture this would look worthless (defs will be weak), but I would satisfy any Flowtype defs for Vue becaue of facebook/flow#1548. tl;dr: you can't both `import` module and flow-ignore it, you'll get error in either case. I personally use stub for Vue which is created by flow-typed. It silences all errors but effectively checks nothing.@kazupon, any updates on this? I'd enjoy using Flow type checking with Vue but it actually looks like they are interested only in React ecosystem atm.This would be a nice feature indeed.@kazupon any news about that? Thanks!Until this-type: facebook/flow#452 and library augmentation: facebook/flow#396 are supported in Flow hardly can we take any further action.@kazupon what about providing partial `flow` support for now? Is it possible?

I know, that we can not extend existing library definitions, but still. I had some experiments to be able to annotate `vue` + `vuex`. I came up with something like this (oversimplifying here):

```
// @flow

interface Vue {
  $isServer: boolean;
  $on(event: string, callback: Function): any;
}

interface Vuex$Vue {
  $store: Object;
}

class MyComponent implements Vue, Vuex$Vue {
  $isServer = false
  $store = {}
  
  $on (event: string, callback: Function) {
  	callback(event)
  }
}
```

So instead of:

TS users should now use:

``` js
import Vue from 'vue'

...which is consistent with recommended plain ES usage.

This is technically a breaking change, but since we've already unintentionally caused a breaking change for webpack 2 + TS users, we should probably just fully migrate to ES-based exports to avoid more breakage in the future.

@ktsn @HerringtonDarkholme  this will likely also affect `vue-class-component` and `av-ts`, so I'd like to get some feedback on whether this will cause potential issues.I need some local test here. Please kindly wait a moment. I guess this typing change will be fine for webpack users.
But I'm not sure about commonjs users. It seems to break some TypeScript libraries that directly depends on Vue. They need to be updated and also the updated library does not seem to be compatible with old (commonjs style) Vue. It's because TypeScript does not interop ESModule and CommonJS at all (as same as export).

```ts
// commonjs style import
import Vue = require('vue')

// will be compiled to ...
var Vue = require('vue')
```

```ts
// esmodule style import
import Vue from 'vue'

// will be compiled to ...
var Vue = require('vue').default
```@ktsn I think we will need to break something for consistent import style across TS/JS. 

But we should consider what part should we break. Or what should we support.What exactly is the runtime semantics? Vue is a CJS importable entity, but it's written as ES modules, so how are you transforming your code right now?

Also, what is the original source of breakage for TypeScript users?Hi @DanielRosenwasser . Vue now outputs a es module file for webpack/rollup users. So tree shaking will work. And Vue has supported commonjs output file as well. These two versions are compiled into two files by two different rollup configs.

For node/browserfiy users, they use vue.common.js, specified by `main` entry in package.json. The export is done via `module.exports = Vue` and imported by `require('vue')`.

For webpack/rollup users, they use vue.esm.js, specified by `module` entry in package.json. The export is `export default Vue` and is imported by `import Vue from 'vue'`. 

Library authors will also want to support both ESM and commonjs. Babel/webpack has compatbile require builtin. If an author writes library in Babel, Babel will take care of how Vue is imported. So library users can freely use ESM/commonjs and the author will need simply write one `import Vue from 'vue'`, regardless of it is executed in node like commonjs environment or webpack like es module environment.

However, TypeScript does not have builtin compatible library. An author must choose one style `import Vue from 'vue'` or `import Vue = require('vue')`. TypeScript compiles different code. And different style output is not mutually compatible. After some thoughts, maybe there is something that can be done in webpack 2. Right now the problem is that with the `module` field present in `package.json`, webpack will always use it regardless of the import syntax the user is using:

``` js
import Vue from 'vue' // <- gets the default export from the ESM build

const Vue = require('vue') // <- returns { __esModule: true, default: Vue }
```

IMO the `module` field should only be respected when the user is using ES modules import syntax. If a raw `require()` is used, it should use the `main` field instead.

/cc @TheLarkInnAnd for now, I think the best path forward is recommend Vue + TS users to start using `allowSyntheticDefaultImports: true` and use ES imports everywhere. This way when this PR lands they don't need to do anything.Let me summarize some findings. Sorted by effort required.

1. For webpack users: it needs minimal effort, just changing import style is enough.

2. For library authors: they need to use webpack to compile their libraries for commonjs / esm compatibility. [Example](https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme/av-ts/commit/160cdd9dc0c871ab792c3efd729f157460467d3f).

3. For plain tsc users/ browserify users: they need use babel for a compatible `require`.

I'd rather argue the break in case 3 is sooner or later: e.g. by node-esm spec. (My speculation is not many users are using browserify + ts + vue, but if they do use this combo at least babel will come to rescue.) FYI, updated TypeScript usage docs: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/typescript.html> And for now, I think the best path forward is recommend Vue + TS users to start using allowSyntheticDefaultImports: true and use ES imports everywhere. This way when this PR lands they don't need to do anything.

The problem is that TypeScript doesn't actually synthesize the default export for a CJS module - this will type-check just fine, but will not work at runtime. `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` only assumes that you have a loader that will do the right thing (e.g. SystemJS). Does Webpack provide this functionality? Otherwise users will need to run their output through Babel.@DanielRosenwasser for webpack 1 yes the user would have to use babel for interop. Webpack 2 uses the ES module build automatically so the semantics align. Webpack 1 is considered deprecated and upgrading to 2 doesn't require much effort, so we'd prefer sticking to es modules in all cases.Sure - it'd be AMD and Webpack 1 that would have problems though. I don't know how many people are using the former, but I'll take your word on the latter. I see you already added `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` to the documentation, so that should help people there.@DanielRosenwasser while we are on this topic - is it possible to allow packages to configure a different d.ts for different module formats? Similar to how the convention for webpack 2 is using ""module"" for ES modules build and ""main"" for CommonJS build, it would be helpful to have something like maybe ""module-types"" for d.ts with es style exports... or maybe something that allows the user to manually specify the d.ts for a specific module in tsconfig.json, like ""resolve.alias"" in webpack.> or maybe something that allows the user to manually specify the d.ts for a specific module in tsconfig.json, like ""resolve.alias"" in webpack.

This *sort of* works if you use path-mapping (using the `paths` option in your `tsconfig.json`), but it ends up feeling odd. If this ends up being part of the CommonJS interop spec (I'm on a cell phone so this is hard to look up right now) then we will need to do it (cc @mhegazy @vladima).Closing in favor of #5887.",

```
{ display: ['-webkit-box', '-webkit-flex', '-ms-flexbox', 'flex'] }

sffc,4975,,Adding the ability to suppress notifications in Vue.set and Vue.delete,closed,2017-02-20,"Currently, whenever you call `Vue.set` or `Vue.delete`, all observers on the object being modified are executed.  This is a ""safe"" practice, because it ensures that any objects who had previously attempted to access the key being added or deleted get their dependencies re-computed.

However, consider the case where you have an object with many different keys and watchers, which might be expensive to call.  In this case, `Vue.set` will do a lot of work executing all of the watchers, even if none of them respond to the new field in the object, causing poor performance.

Here is a fiddle to demonstrate the issue: https://jsfiddle.net/exe3nxzg/2/ .  Adding new keys to the object causes the watcher on the original field to be triggered, even though that watcher doesn't care about the values of the new keys.

This PR offers a possible fix to the problem, which is to add an options object as the final argument of `Vue.set` and `Vue.delete`.  If the user wishes to manually suppress notifications on the object and prevent all watchers from being computed, they can pass `{ notify: false }` as the final argument.

Another possible fix would be to add a new function called `Vue.get`.  If `Vue.set` replaces the syntax `obj[key]=value` and `Vue.delete` replaces the syntax `delete obj[key]`, then `Vue.get` would replace the syntax `obj[key] || default`.  More precisely, a definition could look something like:

```js
Vue.get = function(obj, key, defaultValue) {
	if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
		// create the key on the object with the default value.
		// call defineReactive(), etc.
		// however, do NOT call notify on the object.
	}
	return obj[key];
};
```

This way, whenever a key access is attempted, a reactive is left behind, such that setting the property in the future, even via `Vue.set`, will not cause a full notify.

Thoughts?",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/4975,"['flow/component.js', 'flow/global-api.js', 'src/core/global-api/index.js', 'src/core/instance/state.js', 'src/core/observer/index.js', 'test/unit/features/instance/methods-data.spec.js', 'test/unit/modules/observer/observer.spec.js', 'test/unit/modules/observer/watcher.spec.js', 'types/vue.d.ts']",,,"I fixed the lint failures.For why it needs to trigger notification for anything that depends on the object itself, consider the following expression:

``` js
a.b + c
```

When `a` is still `{}`, `a.b` will not be able to detect a dependency on the key `.b`, because the getter doesn't exist yet. The only way to ensure this expression gets re-evaluated when `.b` is created, is by registering the entire object `a` as the expression's dependency. This is simply how Vue's reactivity system works given the current constraints.

That said, I don't really understand the use case for this PR. The only reason you'd use `Vue.set` is to explicitly trigger updates. If you don't trigger a notification on the object itself at the time of registering a new key, then expressions like the one mentioned above will never know a new key was added and will never update.Here's my use case.  I have an object that caches results from I/O operations, indexed by their filename.  For example, `data.cache[""/path/to/filename.png""]`.  A watcher can subscribe to one or more of the keys in the cache, and they should update whenever their particular field changes.  At an instant in time, the cache contains around 20 keys.  However, each field in the cache can have multiple watchers, so there may be several hundred watchers.  Triggering a notify on every single watcher when a new key is added to the cache is very expensive.

My pattern for subscribing to a new key currently looks like:

```js
if (!cache.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
	Vue.set(cache, key, null, { notify: false });
}
// do stuff with cache[key]
```

In other words, I'm careful to make sure that the field exists prior to accessing it via the `[]` operator, in order to avoid the problem Evan mentioned.

Giving this a second thought, I think the better way forward might be to add the *Vue.get()* function instead of the `{ notify: false }` option parameter.  The implementation of *Vue.get()* would be something along the lines of:

```js
/**
 * Gets a property from an object, creating the property with the specified default value
 * if it does not exist.
 */
export function get (obj: Array<any> | Object, key: any, defaultVal: any) {
  if (hasOwn(obj, key)) {
    return obj[key]
  }
  const ob = obj.__ob__
  if (!ob) {
    return obj[key]
  }
  defineReactive(ob.value, key, defaultVal)
  return obj[key]
}
```

This way, when you are tempted to write `a.b + c`, you can instead write `Vue.get(a, ""b"", 0) + c` and ensure that you are subscribed to future changes to that field.

Although this approach would in effect prevent the ""global notify"" from *Vue.set()*, it would still trigger one from *Vue.del()*, which is not fully desirable.

Thoughts?> Triggering a notify on every single watcher when a new key is added to the cache is very expensive.

Watcher expressions (the first argument to `watch`) are not designed to be heavyweight. Complex logic should go to the watcher handler instead.

Your watcher handler gets executed exactly because you artificially return an object from the watch expression. If you weren't doing that, there's wouldn't be a problem in the first place.

Here is your modified demo with five thousand watchers (an order of magnitude more than several hundred), giving decent performance: https://jsfiddle.net/simplesmiler/exe3nxzg/3/. With this much watchers (assuming you have a few watchers per component) the performance of watcher expressions would not be a bottleneck.

Can you provide a reproduction where executing several hundred watch expressions (without artificially returning distinct values) actually causes performance issues?My watchers do image manipulations, which are synchronous activities that run on the order of milliseconds.  A hundred watchers and you're waiting close to a second for everyone to re-compute.  [Here is an example](https://github.com/sffc/vue-watcher-demo) for illustration.  Run the example using `npm start`, which will start up a local server.  On the server, click the ""Load Next Image"" button a few times.  Even after just 5 or 6 clicks, there is a noticeable lag.  This being said, I could probably figure out a way to hack the image manipulations into the handler function, but the code wouldn't be as clean.

Also, I noticed that [in core/instance/state.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/instance/state.js#L142), functions you set as a ""computed"" simply get delegated as watcher expressions.  It says [in the guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html#Computed-Caching-vs-Methods) (emphasis mine):

> Why do we need caching? Imagine we have *an expensive computed property A, which requires looping through a huge Array and doing a lot of computations*. Then we may have other computed properties that in turn depend on A. Without caching, we would be executing A‚Äôs getter many more times than necessary! In cases where you do not want caching, use a method instead.

In other words, the guide seems to indicate that it's OK to have an expensive function as your computed, and in turn as your watcher expression.

*Even if* the watcher expressions are lightweight, I still don't like the idea of re-computing them when we know for sure that their dependencies haven't changed.  If I have a watcher listening on `cache.a`, creating `cache.b` logically shouldn't cause the other watcher to re-compute as it does now.

---

I've been hacking around in my copy of Vue, and I committed two new features to my branch.  I reverted the `{notify:false}` suggestion.

1. A modification to *Vue.delete()* that triggers notifications only on subscriptions to the property that was deleted, instead of globally to the object.  This is purely an internal optimization; the external behavior is the same, as all watchers that need to be notified get notified.
2. An implementation of *Vue.get()*, the function I had mentioned previously.  I actually like the *Vue.get()* API better than the `{notify:false}` API because if you use it correctly, your app will get faster, and if you don't use it, you simply get the old behavior.

Feature 1 doesn't seem to have any real downsides, and there are no changes to the API.

The gotcha with Feature 2 is that if you mix call sites (with some using *Vue.get()* and with others using the `[]` operator), the call sites using `[]` risk never getting their subscriptions added.  This only happens if you mix `[]` with *Vue.get()* on the same property, and there is a test case demonstrating it.  However, the guide already recommends that you use the sister functions *Vue.set()* and *Vue.delete()* globally, so as long as this restriction is well-documented, I think it should be okay.So - I appreciate the feedback and effort put into this PR, but I'm not convinced of the tradeoff of adding a new API for such a specific use case. In particular, the original perf problem can be circumvented by checking if the specific key has the same value (since you already know which key you depend on).

In the future Proxy-based reactivity system, this problem will go away without the need for an explicit API. Adding an API in the current version to solve a problem that doesn't exist in a future version means we will have to remove it when the new version lands, so ideally we want to avoid that.","Tests failed because you didn't follow the lint rules. We only use single quotes.you should test the amount of calls before this line as wellsame hereAcknowledged. I changed the PR to not use the `{notify:false}` API anymore, but I still have it saved in a branch if we want to restore it."

Continuing the work done in https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools/pull/260, I'm proposing a change for a bit more dynamic `_uid`s, by adding a small random offset to them.

This will allow components from multiple Vue dependencies to be inspectable in `vue-devtools` without any hassle. Also, one thing to note is the fact that [transitions](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/f7062b9b75179a0a515205e47cfe6227f33b95f0/src/platforms/web/runtime/components/transition.js#L134) may break in some rare cases.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/4973,['src/core/instance/init.js'],,,"@andreiglingeanu simple test proofs that your solution makes them even less unique:

let uids = []

  uids.push((Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1) + uid)
}

for (let i = 0; i < uids.length; i++) {
  let uid = uids[i]
  let matches = uids.filter(_uid => _uid === uid).length
  if (matches > 1) {
    console.warn(`${uid} generated ${matches} times`)
  }

@vectart This will be guaranteed to not break anything in the current projects because we are doing the `uid` increment besides relying on the randomness of `Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1`.

Actually, increasing the maximum number for the `Math.random` expression will make those repetitions occur not that often. And, it won't be the end of the world if they'll repeat.

Do you think bringing a general purpose uuid algorithm will be more suitable?

cc. @yyx990803 With enough _randomness_ I'm not getting repetitions at all.

![](https://i.imgur.com/XOOMPgr.png)Unfortunately I don't think this would work. Although it makes uids from multiple copies of Vue less likely to clash, it also makes the uids **less** unique when there's only a single copy of Vue. ""A big random number"" is simply not safe.

In addition, the internal scheduler relies on an important characteristics of the uids: the earlier an instance is created, the smaller its uid is. The scheduler uses this to determine job priorities.

I think a better fix to your original problem (multiple copies of Vue with vue-devtools) is (from within devtools) detecting multiple copies of Vue and assign each copy an id, then prefix all instance ids with the Vue id they are associated with.Got that. Thank you. I'll give a thought to your idea. @andreiglingeanu btw what I described is a change in devtools not in Vue coreYeah, I got that. Thank you once again. ",

v-stein,4933,feature request,Added the possibility to have function declared as required propOption,closed,2017-02-14,"Added the possibility to declare a function as value for required PropOption which should return a truthy or falsy value as the following:
```JavaScript
props: {
  myProp: {
    type: String,
    required: function () {
      /* Treatment here */
      return result // truthy or falsy
    }
  }
}
```",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/4933,"['flow/options.js', 'src/core/util/props.js', 'types/options.d.ts']",,,"Why do you need the required property to change? I can understand it changing depending on other props (eg one of two different props being required) but in that case, you wouldn't be able to rely on it because of the order. What is your usecase?The case I needed it is a component which has two different ""states"" (one to create and another to modify).
Thus, there are some properties that are needed in a state, but not in the other.
So here would be the case:
```JavaScript
props: {
  state: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    validator: function (val) {
      return !!~['create','edit'].indexOf(val)
    }
  },
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: function () {
      return this.state === 'edit'
    }
  }
}
```
If you are in edit mode, you have to pass some content as you can't have something to edit where there's nothing, and you can have pre-loaded content in create mode.

Of course, the order of the props is important in that case, as not all of it will be loaded, but it could give some more power and flexibility to props (still there are some workarounds).> Of course, the order of the props is important in that case, as not all of it will be loaded, but it could give some more power and flexibility to props (still there are some workarounds).

What I was saying is that using an object doesn't let you rely on the order. Furthermore, you may want something like

```js
props: {
  one: {
    required () {
      'one' in this || 'two' in this
    },
  two: {
    required () {
      'one' in this || 'two' in this
    }
}
```

But that'd require the `required` function to be called after all props have been initialized.
IMO this is more of a validator function but it's true that validator doesn't have access to `this` (it's a pure function).imo relying on other props in the initialization phase can be problematic because the Object enumeration order is inconsistent in different JavaScript engines - e.g. your code may work in Chrome but break in Safari.

I think it's safer to just check and emit your custom warning in the `created` hook of your component when all props have been initialized.That's right that browsers are really capricious with objects.
Well, seems like I'll stay with workarounds üëç I recommend you to add checks on the `created` hook and display warnings that are stripped off in when bundling in production (this needs some Webpack/rollup configuration):

```js
// inside of created
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
// check here
}
```

I think it's better to just add a runtime config option. We will likely address this in the next release.Hi Evan. ( @yyx990803 )

Thanks for addressing the suggestion. 

I had a feeling I was skating on thin ice with this solution, but I didn't want to disrupt what seems to be a ""no configuration"" mantra of Vue too much and this was the only way I could figure it out. 

On that point, it seems to me, this mantra is what makes the warning necessary in the first place. There are certainly clear decisions that userland should make, one being setting up Vue for development or production and I think it is ok to allow that as a config setting. 

So, I request this not simply be a decision to remove the warning with an extra flag, but rather to have a clear setting for userland to setup Vue to run in ""production"" or ""development"" mode. This would negate the necessity of the warning altogether, because the situation ""production"" or ""development"" is then a userland responsibility and not a possible mistake of using Vue incorrectly.

If the previous instance was crashed by accident, some shared variables might still remain the old value when creating the new instance.

## Modification

In particular, the following variables have the protential risk of memory crosstalk:

+ [`core/observer/dep.js`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/994aee4f869d68a00c3b9d87daa9c8d84623ac42/src/core/observer/dep.js#L48-L49)

  + `targetStack`
+ [`core/observer/scheduler.js`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/994aee4f869d68a00c3b9d87daa9c8d84623ac42/src/core/observer/scheduler.js#L12-L16)
  + `queue`
  + `has`
  + `circular`
  + `waiting`
  + `flushing`

The modification is simple: Just reset those variables to its initial value before `createInstance` and `destroyInstance`. (*Actually, reset the value in `createInstance` is enough, but do likewise in `destroyInstance` is more reliable*)

The page will show `A` and `2` initially. After one second, the `Vue.delete` statement will occur an error, the call stack would be canceled, but right now, the `flushing` variable in scheduler is `true`.

Refresh the page (on native), will get `1` and `2`, which is not correct. Because the initial value of `flushing` is `true` in scheduler, the watcher of `lists` will never run.

I think the cleaner way to handle this is probably expose Vue via a factory function and basically create a new instance of Vue for each Weex instance. (which would also solve the `Vue.config` usage problem)The `createInstance` and `destroyInstance` is called by native, which depends on the user's behavior. Even in the same *activity* would contain multi Weex instance.

I also think expose Vue through factory function is a more elegant way to fix this. But doing that may change too much (still worthy), and should also take care of those variables in closure.

I personally prioritise readability over vertical space on a readmeStill personal preference, but to me it's easier to read: ""Browser: version, version, version"" instead of  the matrix style.

mitar,4652,pending,Necessary changes to observer for full Tracker compatibility,closed,2017-01-05,"(This is all open for debate and I understand that it is previously undiscussed pull request, but it is easier to debate it with concrete code changes available.)

I am working on integration of Vue with [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) and I would like that Vue could be a drop-in replacement for Blaze. That is almost possible, because architecture is very similar. Vue is also using reactive dependency tracking, observer, while Meteor/Blaze is using [Tracker](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages/tracker). Now, there is a lot of code written for Meteor which is using Tracker and it would be great if it could just work with Vue. And in fact it is doable. I managed to create a [full 100% compatible Tracker implementation on top of Vue's observer](https://github.com/mitar/vue-test/blob/master/packages/tracker/tracker.js). But there are some changes necessary to observer's implementation and some internals have to be exposed.

This pull request is initial version of changes I had to do to get this first version of Tracker implemented, to get discussion rolling. I would really like to see if this or something like this could get merged into Vue. From my perspective changes do not really change how observer is working, and all existing tests are still passing.

A list of changes:

* added support for after flush callbacks
* adding a way to force flushing
* fixed exception recovery for pushTarget/popTarget
* correctly cleanup queue if there is an exception from getter
* exposing some internals (probably too much, API could be cleaner there)

Requesting comments, feedback, suggestions. This is work in progress. I will add tests in the future, after we finalize that this is OK to do and everything else.

Please refer: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines@defcc: I thought I did. Which part from the guide I am missing? I will add tests later for new features. I will fix failing tests now. Is there anything else?Hm, tests are now failing at ""should get updated with model when in focus"" which seems unrelated to my changes? Flaky tests?Thanks @mitar , I opened a PR to fix that error.Tests are passing.Hey, I think this is an interesting approach, but here's why I think it's unlikely to get merged: these changes increases the public API surface and will impact how we can make changes in Vue in the future.

By exposing the internals, it creates a liability for Vue to keep these APIs intact in order to stick to semver (otherwise it would break anything that relies on them, e.g. your Tracker wrapper). However, the scheduler and the reactivity system really is considered internal, and I intend to keep them internal so that we can iterate and make non-trivial changes to them without affecting the public API. There are a few experiments going on currently (e.g. using ES6 Proxy for change detection, slicing scheduler workload with `requestIdleCallback`) that all may cause changes to how the scheduler/Watcher/Dep system works, but if these internal implementation details become part of the public API, it places a serious constraint on how we can iterate on things in the future.

I do see the benefits here in that it allows the two reactivity systems to integrate more seamlessly, however I'm not sure whether it justifies adding the extra liability.

For now, a fork seems like the best short-term solution to me. In the long run, I will probably refactor Vue's reactivity system so that it can be exposed in a way that is less coupled to the internal details.@yyx990803, thank you for your answer.

I do understand your position, but I also think that there are some alternatives available here.

I am not sure what is your position of using `_` prefixed symbols. But this could be one way to expose those internals in a way to communicate that those symbols are internal and could break at any point and using them requires that consumer makes sure things work and things are integrated correctly. For example, from our side we could simply exactly require specific version of Vue and upgrade it in Meteor package only after a new version is tested. But at the same time, some other developer can try and force a new version much easier than forking our fork and changing things there to get this new version.

Another approach would be to provide a very simple API to register an ""observer"" module with which one can override default observer code (`Dep`, `Watcher`, and `queueWatcher`). Only the API of those would be fixed, but internal implementation would be left to the module to implement.Exposing internals with _ while considering them not part of the public API seems fine to me. And the Meteor integration could pin the version of Vue.@yyx990803, have you made a final decision on this? :)  

We in the Meteor/Blaze community need this change in order to move over to your framework!  There's a lot of developers over there waiting excitedly for this development!  

Can't we compromise on this by using the ""_"" to expose just the few internals we need?  We understand if you decided to make breaking changes to this portion of the API we're on our own.  Heck, shut down the said APIs if there is a breaking change and we'll be responsible for updating said APIs and brining them back online once everything passes.

I believe the effort will expose a entire community to your UI framework, possibly increasing the mindshare and popularity!I love to see the enthusiasm of Meteor community for this. :-) Thanks.

Just to be clear, exposing symbols with `_` is not enough, there are also some changes needed the code as shown in this pull request:
* added support for after flush callbacks
* adding a way to force flushing

(BTW, I will add tests for all those changes if we decide to merge this pull request.)

An alternative approach, of providing a way to register a custom implementation of `Dep`, `Watcher`, `queueWatcher` would allow us to simple completely swap the implementation, but of course the downside is that this common code would not be maintained (and especially coordinated!) together, which is a downside. But on the other hand it would not require from you to maintain this part of codebase.

I would also like to point out that some things should probably be merged in any case. I found out that current code is very bad at recovering from any exception, leaving the whole system in an undefined state. You can only reload to recover. This is why I added things like:
* fixed exception recovery for pushTarget/popTarget
* correctly cleanup queue if there is an exception from getter

Meteor Tracker tests are pretty hard on testing those edge cases and this is how I found them.If this will be possible, in whatever form, I dare say that Vue will become the default used framework with Meteor. At least for everyone still on Blaze. This would be the most sophisticated and incremental way to start using Vue. Good for both communities!

I started rendering some parts of our app with React. Although React is a great framework, it feels like a mismatch with Meteor. Or tracker, to be more precise.

I truly hope this interoperability will see the light of day!Resolved merge conflicts with current `dev` branch.@yyx990803, you added a 'pending' label to this PR.  Sorry, but what does this mean for us waiting on this change to integrate Vue into our existing Meteor projects?  Do you plan to merge this PR?

Just in case: Blaze has been broken out from Meteor and is now a stand alone project.  @mitar is the primary owner/maintainer for Blaze (no longer MDG).  He is trying to use Vue as the foundation of a Blaze 2 that will serve as the ""default"" UI for Meteor (the alternative is React).  But without this PR, it will be an impossible task.  

@yyx990803, please allow the Meteor community to further migrate towards Vue by accepting this PR and helping @mitar where needed.

Thank you for a super great framework!Great work.This is super awesome. I really Evan merges this in - thousands of Meteor apps that might switch to Vue as a result of this package.  I moved forked Tracker into its own repo: https://github.com/meteor-vue/tracker

Also, this software looks comprehensive and might have the feature you're looking for: https://www.realartists.com/blog/ship-20.html@yyx990803: What is your take on how to integrate Minimongo the best? Now that we have proper Tracker support, it means that if you do `collection.find().fetch()` inside Vue computed function, it will rerun on every change, as expected. But what should we do if you return `collection.find()`? Should we do anything smart, or just call `fetch()` on it and Object.freeze it? We should also make so that Vue uses `_id` as a default key for Minimongo results (arrays or cursors). Should we specially handle cursors so that Vue observes changes to underlying data without having to compare whole arrays?I have finished integrating Tracker with Vue. I think the result looks amazing. There are some internals we could continue improving, but I think that interface for developers works well.

To showcase it, I implemented [TodoMVC](https://github.com/meteor-vue/todomvc) in it. See [this file](https://github.com/meteor-vue/todomvc/blob/master/client/todos-display.vue) for an example of Vue component using familiar Meteor concepts, like reactivity, subscriptions and methods. (And also some custom packages, to show how they continue working as they worked in Blaze.)

Some [instructions how to use it can be found here](https://github.com/meteor-vue/guide). ~~After more people tested it and more feedback, we can work on putting this into a package and more reusable form.~~

Also, this is on purpose very non-MVVM and trying to be as close to what experience with Blaze is. (So subscribing to data, calling methods to modify data on events, without any fancy multi-way data binding.) Those things can be [future work](https://github.com/meteor-vue/vue-meteor/issues/77).

Comments and feedback welcome. Best place for that [is this issue](https://github.com/meteor-vue/vue-meteor-tracker/issues/3).

This is all possible because of the amazing work by @akryum! It is just combining things he made in a bit different way.

One potential step (which I am not planing to do personally, but would invite somebody to do) is to convert spacebars compiler to convert Blaze template syntax to Vue templates, in a similar way how [Vue allows to use Pug/Jade](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html).Also see #6079 with some more useful changes which would help make Minimongo integration smoother. (I am still unclear what would be the best way to do that integration.)Any updates to this issue?

> I'm using @mitar's [fork](https://github.com/meteor-vue/vue), but maybe it would be interesting to have an official integrationMy [previous comment](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/4652#issuecomment-270746417) still stands true as we've planned to do a reactivity system overhaul (using Proxies internally) in early 2018. The chance for this PR to be compatible with the upgrade will be slim. If the need for Meteor integration is still in reasonable demand at that point, we can revisit what that entails after the upgrade.What would be the best way for me to be involved in that system overhaul to help make sure things can work together from the very beginning. So that it is not a later change which as you see now is much harder to get in?

I think that 38 upvotes on this pull request is clear that there is some demand for this.

Also, why not still merge this in as it is now, and then as upgrade happens, also the new system could contain things useful for Meteor?The main issue: the changes are too intrusive, so it is essentially asking the Vue team to take on liability, design constraints and potential technical debt for some need that is entirely induced by a 3rd party system.

In order to get involved in the process, it'd be helpful to have a proper write up of what is fundamentally preventing Vue's reactivity system to work with Tracker's; and instead of directly changing Vue's internals, providing a desired API surface that you'd like to see exposed (even better, test cases of these exposed APIs). That helps us gauge the constraints better and maybe can come up with something that decouples the two systems better.> In order to get involved in the process, it'd be helpful to have a **proper write up of what is fundamentally preventing Vue's reactivity system to work with Tracker's**; and instead of directly changing Vue's internals, **providing a desired API surface that you'd like to see exposed (even better, test cases of these exposed APIs)**.

@mitar do you have any plans on providing the stuff he's asking for above or have you moved on from this effort? @aadamsx, thanks for reminding me to reply here.

@yyx990803, I think there might be a slight misunderstanding here (of what this pull request is doing, or of what I am trying to achieve), so just to make sure I will summarize it. I ported Meteor's Tracker on top of Vue's reactivity system. Vue's is really a great reactivity system and Tracker was able to be ported to it with almost 1:1 API mapping only. The only small differences are that Tracker has some more hooks to be called (like after each invalidation, allowing to force flushing, small things like that). This PR might look intrusive, but it is mostly just adding such places for hooking in.

So I see two options, the first being this PR:
* Vue reactivity system exposes few more callbacks so that Tracker can be directly built as a API transformation on top of Vue reactivity system (personally, I do not see it as too intrusive, but this is your call, and maybe they could even be made cleaner than I made them)
* Vue makes its reactivity system pluggable, so that user can say, ""hey, instead of this default implementation, swap it with this other JS module""; it would be on the second module to assure compatibility with default system

I think based on the feedback you gave here, I think the second approach would be better. Instead of us having to define API space and have to push back and forth on which callbacks Tracker would need and which one you would be OK to provide, you just freely design Vue reactivity system how it is, just allow that somebody can call something like `Vue.useReactivity(module)` and it would start using the new module instead. And if new module is buggy, it is on their maintainers to make it compatible. Based on PR here I see it that it would be easy to maintain such alternative implementation exposing few more callbacks. And it would be easier than providing the whole fork of Vue.

What do you think of this approach?

Just one reply from before:

> we've planned to do a reactivity system overhaul (using Proxies internally) in early 2018

So because I am building Tracker on top of Vue reactivity system, I do not think it is really important how internally you implement it. I am glad that Vue reactivity system has a concept of ""user"" watchers but beyond that it is just using the external API. See [here for details](https://github.com/meteor-vue/tracker/blob/master/tracker.js#L226).I heard the Vue logo is on Meteor.com - it sounds like this is going well :)@yyx990803, what do you think about ideas I made above how we could make this work for both communities?@yyx990803 ping. Is there a better channel to communicate about this?","Why are you not using default import syntax?

L22: `import Watcher from '../observer/watcher'`
L20: `import Dep,  { pushTarget, popTarget } from '../observer/dep'`No particular reason. I can change it, if you prefer.I find @znck syntax cleaner. :smile:Updated."

Will get back to this after I test it more!I have updated to the latest version 0.12.1. 
This version contains a lot of new features and bug fixes.
For details, see https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/blog/testcafe-v0-12-0-released.htmlWe found that people start using testcafe for vue-based applications.
We wanted to give them the capability to test vue markup and component properties together.

Please, take a look and let us know what you think about it.Since version 0.14.0 TestCafe supports the `file` schema and relative paths for the page directive. 
So, I removed the `http-server` module from `package.json` and changed all tests to relative paths.Hey - really thanks for starting this PR and sticking with us, and sorry for letting this stand for so long. The truth is, over the time our need for e2e testing in the core repo itself hasn't really changed much, and we haven't found much benefit in changing our setup to a different tool. I'm sure there are certain things that TestCafe does better than what we are using, but in our use case (the core repo), we just want to avoid the cost of having learn a different API without substantial benefits. IMO, the better to promote TestCafe to Vue users would be creating examples of testing actual projects instead of the core repo.",

A placeholder VNode is same as an emptyVNode, except the new flag set to true. Before this commit, an async component will be rendered to emptyVNode(in `createElement`). After this commit, an async component will be rendered to placeholderVNode. So the behavior in client-side rendering or bailed SSR rendering should be kept.

In SSR hydration, we skip checking a placeholder VNode against a real element. After component is resolved, the Vue instance in question will `$forceUpdate` in callback. So even if the real element dismatches with resolved VNode, rendered dom structure should be up to date. 

**Current implementation cannot reuse dom for async component because `isHydrating` is not available in `createComponent`.**

Another potential problem is that third party code can attach event handler / store data on SSR element. Those information will be lost in `$forceUpdate` callback. But I would suggest library users should care about it because I wonder if a library can provide a silver-bullet strategy.",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/4506,"['src/core/vdom/create-component.js', 'src/core/vdom/patch.js', 'src/core/vdom/vnode.js', 'test/unit/modules/vdom/create-component.spec.js', 'test/unit/modules/vdom/patch/hydration.spec.js']",,['4387'],"This is awesome, will review in depth for 2.2Awesomeüëç

    const router = new VueRouter({

      router
    }).$mount('#app')
    </script>

</html>
```

I guess it's because vue-router has it's own async components resolving function ( https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/blob/dev/src/history/base.js#L244 ), but the `next()` hook is called after `mounted` lifecycle.
@fenivana  Thanks for the investigation! 

> vue-router has it's own async components resolving function

Exactly, the problem is when `router-view` is hydrating against SSR dom, if the matched component is async component, `router-view` will return an emptyVNode as placeholder. After component is matched, router-view get re-rendered.

To Vue core, `router-view` is a synchronous component that will always yield a VNode. If we can change it to async component this problem might be solved.

Update: @fenivana it seems that change router-view to async component solves this. Online demo

https://herringtondarkholme.github.io/vue-advanced-programming/async/@HerringtonDarkholme  Oh I see..

BTW, I think forceUpdate is not so ideal.. Is there a way to use the same strategy as the normal components, Perhaps start SSR hydration only after all child async components have been resolved?@fenivana the current hydration strategy allows the synchronous part of your app to be interactive before async components are resolved, this reduces the ""uncanny valley"" effect where user can see the markup but cannot interact with it.

Also, `$forceUpdate` in 2.x is very cheap (just re-rendering a single component without any actual DOM updates, and it's buffered too).@yyx990803 Okay, that sounds reasonable. But as @HerringtonDarkholme said,

> Current implementation cannot reuse dom for async component because isHydrating is not available in createComponent.

And I did some tests confirmed this. The DOM of component `<foo>` will be wiped out and replaced with new DOM. So I thought using a same strategy would be a simpler solution.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset=""utf-8"">
    <script src=""node_modules/vue/dist/vue.js""></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div id=""app"" server-rendered=""true""><div class=""foo"">foo</div></div>

    <script>
    window.foo1 = document.querySelector('.foo')

    new Vue({
      el: '#app',

      template: '<div id=""app""><foo></foo></div>',

      components: {
        foo: resolve => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            resolve({
              template: '<div class=""foo"">foo</div>',

              mounted() {
                window.foo2 = document.querySelector('.foo')
                console.log(foo1 === foo2) // false
              }
            })
          })
        }
      }
    })
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```


I think the ""uncanny valley"" is mostly because vendor.js and app.js are put at the end of `<body>`, as long as the HTTP buffers of the end of html haven't been received, and the entry js files haven't beed downloaded, the page is buggy and un-interactive. And generally vendor.js is the biggest and most time consuming. Compared to those factors, the time of loading async components is not so long.

And part of the app can be interactive but another part can't still feels buggy... I prefer simply putting a transparent loading mask layer on top of the page util the page is loaded completely.Extended discussion might be better done at forum.vuejs.org. I just want to clarify two points:

1. Reusing dom needs significant refactor to pass SSR info all around yet the benefit is quite marginal since `$forceUpdate` is fast enough for now. More relevant: arbitrary dom manipulation might occur before component resolved. So swapping SSR dom with new dom is safest approach IMHO. And it is the same as current behavior.

2. I'm afraid waiting for component resolved is the last strategy we would opt for. That will miss the whole point of code splitting.‚òùÔ∏è Typo in the title! ~ascyn~  = asyncSince Vue-router already has [onReady](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router/releases/tag/v2.2.0) landed, I wonder if this feature is still relevant in real world usage. 

Feel free to close this issue if it is not ideal to add more complexity.","Now resolveAsyncComponent will return null if component is rejected. This relies on JavaScript has two kinds of `zero value`. A more canonical solution is to wrap result in a container which has a property indicating resolution status. But it would incur more overhead.

Is current implementation good to you @yyx990803 ?We have a lot of boolean flags here. I think they can be packed into an integer and be retrieved by bitwise operation. Fewer properties should reduces memory consumption since typically we have a lot of VNode instances and probably can prevent multiple hidden class creation.

Maybe a good refactor for another pull request.Yep, that's something I've been thinking about too! Would love a PR for that!hmm maybe have some sort of enum integer consts like `const PENDING = 1` and check if `res === PENDING`resolveAsyncComponent now return an enum for resolution status: `RESOLVED`, `PENDING`, `REJECTED`. It is a function local to create-component so I think it should be fine. Having experimented with number flags, I only see memory consumption only drops 1%, yet manipulating flags is much more verbose than before. I didn't see much value here."

  computed: {
    mul: function () {

      return this.a++

console.log('vm.a =' + vm.a);  //=1
console.log('vm.mul = ' + vm.mul);  //=1
console.log('vm.a =' + vm.a); //=2
console.log('vm.mul = ' + vm.mul);  // log 1 now, log 2 after pr
console.log('vm.count = ', vm.count) // log 11 now, log 12 after pr
```

It also feels strange that a dirty flag is updated before computation gets done, rather than after.@HerringtonDarkholme In your code:
step1:  vm.a// => 1
step2:  vm.mul, run the gotter: go step3
step3:  `this.count < 10` is true and then this.count is 2, go step2 until this.count is 10. Then go step4
step4:  `this.count < 10` is false and then this.count is 11, return this.a
so vm.mul // => 1 and then vm.a is 2
step5: vm.a // => 2 
step6: vm.mul //=> run the getter: this.count is < 10 is false and this.count is 12. return this.a
so vm.mul // => 2 and then vm.a is 3

this also shows the result after pr is correct.

But I agree with you on `a dirty flag is updated before computation gets done, rather than after.` is strange.
Maybe it needs more considerationMy point here is backward compatibility. The behavior is changed and we cannot provide a migration path for this change.

> this also shows the result after pr is correct.

IMHO, correctness here is arguable because Vue has cache functionality which behaves different from native getter/setter. For example, if you insert one side effect in the getter, say `console.log`, you will see logging only once, not twice. This is expected because vue has cached the computed property.

Maybe producing side effect is an undefined behavior in Vue, though. 

Also, consider this. Currently Vue throw an exception for cyclic dependency.

```js
var vm = new Vue({
  data: { a: 1 },
  computed: {
    mul: {
      get() {
        this.mul += 1
        return this.a += 1
      },
      set(val) {
        this.a += val
      }
    }
  }
});
```By design, computed getters should be pure functions and should NOT be producing side effects.",

You need to do proper parsing to prefix all **valid identifiers**, and there's also scope analysis involved inside functions with arguments.
@yyx990803 would you mind explaining this to me or linking me to a place in the code of what you're talking about?

My experience has been that anything that can be done with `with` and `eval` can be done without them (just like any iterative program can be recursive, right?)

By scope analysis do you mean angular-style dynamic injection?

Angular 1 with ng-strict is currently the only framework that works securely in true JavaScript (i.e. ES5.1) without build tools, but it's so bloated. I really want to use vue.js because it seems like it wouldn't require that much to make strict and secure sans build tools and I'm willing to put in work to make that happen.
It's true that it **can** be done, but it's not as trivial as you might have thought.

E.g. how do you transform the following:

``` js
with (this) {
  return h('div', {
    class: { a: someVariable }
  }, list.map(item => h('span', item.text))
}
```
1. Notice that the class binding expression is an object literal: `""{ a: someVariable }""` - you'd need to parse the expression to properly prefix `someVariable` instead of the entire expression. And because users can use arbitrarily complex expressions in the template, you essentially need a full JavaScript parser (which is why ng1 is bloated).
2. Notice inside the scope of the map function, `item` is a local variable because of the argument, and it **should not** be prefixed. This requires keeping track of the identifier information in current function scope while doing the prefixing.

So basically, it is possible, but only with a proper JavaScript parse -> AST transform -> codegen process, a la Babel. This is why in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4115#issuecomment-258525758 I suggest separating the prefixing from the current compiler implementation.

Should vue's semver also take this into consideration? Ping @ktsn @yyx990803 
hm, as the typings is shipped with core, it should also follow the semver?
To avoid breaking change, how about rename the generic interface and create a specific interface that compatible current type? like:

``` js
export interface RenderContextG<P, S> {
  props: P;
  children: VNode[];
  slots: S;
  data: VNodeData;
  parent: Vue;
}

export interface RenderContext extends RenderContextG<any, any> {}
```
It was a huge breaking change the changes of `ComponentOptions` that I did. However, compared to `ComponentOptions`, it will be a smaller impact to change `FunctionalComponentOptions` and `RenderContext`, I think...
I think `ComponentOptions` update was reasonable breaking change because it was not announced officially about typings and needed revisions for brush up as the stage of pre-release.
However, it is now already released and announced, and it seems many users depends on it.
It may be different problem between code and typings but I think we should be careful about this topic.
Then, how about changing only `slot: any` -> `slot(): any`?
I'm gonna make pull request again when preparing 2.1...
It's ok to me.
","Why is this changed to method? In my understand, it should a property of an object.

> Is this a one-liner type of tweak that we could put in our top-level app and everything would inherit?

Yes, if I read the code correct. Place it in your entry file and most things will be fine. (~~with the probable exception of functional component~~, functional component behavior is not changed, you can just use your own createdElement function in render function as long as it returns VNode compatible object)

> Is there another library, module, or mixin (or whatever else) that could be used as an example for this type of feature?

I don't know. I think this is too hacky to be included in a project's README...
@phanan - Is there already a way to support such as custom render function as a Vue plugin?
As it has turned into a discussion, I'd suggest opening a thread on [the forum](http://forum.vuejs.org) instead.

HerringtonDarkholme,4007,in review,SSR: eliminate closure in render.js implementation,closed,2016-10-21,"I'm trying to remove closures in src/server/render.js.

Removing closures can improve runtime performance, enable easier reasoning about memory leakage, and prevent erroneous captured variable reused.  

The basic idea is to pack all captured variable into a `RenderContext` structure. In closure based implementation, all state changes are implicitly stored by wrapping `next` function. In context based implementation state transitions are explicitly recorded in `renderStates` property. 

I have ran a preliminary benchmark [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yxUXYqelR7VcyFHXXVBvZY9iBIr422I6uO8K2P8aU0M/edit#gid=0) by running `npn run bench:ssr`.

",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/3719,"['src/platforms/web/runtime/directives/model.js', 'src/platforms/web/util/index.js']",,,"For cases where a select element is inside a `v-if`, `hook:mounted` would have already been called. Using just `setTimeout` works fine.
Have you tried just changing the `bind` hook to `inserted` instead?
Changing [#L24](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/054b96bd7079bf54a079d1f17bea3f215970fdea/src/platforms/web/runtime/directives/model.js#L24) to `inserted` only doesn't fix the issue. It seems you have to wait for a certain period after insertion before re-setting selection.

When `inserted` is called,  `selectedIndex` is already `0` when it should be `-1`.

Further playing round with various scenarios (select elements in root template, sub components, inside v-if, inside v-for) the following two options work:

### 1

Add the `inserted` hook and place IE workaround here. Can't check for `selectedIndex === -1` as it's already been reset by IE. Using `setTimeout` causes minor UI flicker (where select element value is changing) so `setSelected` instantly called then called against in `setTimeout`.

``` javascript
  inserted (el, binding, vnode) {
    if((isIE || isEdge) && vnode.tag === 'select') {
      // IE/Edge will set selectedIndex to 0 in cases
      // where it should be -1, force the select to refresh.
      setSelected(el, binding, vnode.context)
      setTimeout(() => {
        setSelected(el, binding, vnode.context)
      }, 0)
    }
  },
```

### 2

Similar to the current PR, workaround is placed in the `setSelected` function. `selectedIndex === -1` so workaround will only run when this is the case. To prevent recursion `_v_ieselectdone` state is saved on the el. `setSelected` is called twice, once in `nextTick` and once in `setTimeout` to prevent UI flicker

``` javascript
  if ((isIE || isEdge) && el.selectedIndex === -1 && !el._v_ieselectdone) {
    // IE/Edge will set selectedIndex to 0 in cases
    // where it should be -1, force the select to refresh.
    el._v_ieselectdone = true
    nextTick(() => {
      setSelected(el, binding, vm)
    })
    setTimeout(() => {
      setSelected(el, binding, vm)
    }, 0)
  }
```

Let me know which one you prefer.
Hmm, using `inserted` seems to be working fine for me in all cases - can you specify where it's not working as intended?

Edit: I can see there are issues when refreshing the page IE is trying to be smart to preserve previous selection... I think just setting it again with `nextTick` in `bind` is enough.
Thanks a lot of looking into this - I need to get a release out before getting off work today so I implemented your 1st suggestion (with your credit in the commit message https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/403f3ccb4ce5ecf920fde6b23615e11b772214b2) - hope you don't mind!

blocka,3710,,Allow for function as child,closed,2016-09-20,"Function as a child is a very powerful pattern employed in react.  It allows the consumer of a component to choose how to render a component, while having access to data passed down by the parent.

It is similar to slots, in a way, except slots only gain you access to the data in the hosting component.

For more information on the possibilities that this pattern enables, please see [this blog post](https://medium.com/merrickchristensen/function-as-child-components-5f3920a9ace9), [this presentation from Ryan Florence at React Rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp-NOggyz54), as well as the new API for [React Router 4.0](https://react-router.now.sh/).

Before I go on, I do want to say that the pattern is achievable right now using props:

It is possible now to mimic this using props with the following pattern:

```
const ComponentWithInfo = {
    props: ['render'],
    render (h) {
       return this.render('Hello, World');
    }
}

new Vue({
    render (h) {
         return <ComponentWithData render={data => <span>{data}</span>}></ComponentWithData>
    }
})
```

However, ""first-class"" support would be nice.

As far as the vue flavor, the API looks like this:

```
const ComponentWithInfo = {
    render (h) {
       return this.$slots.default('Hello, World')
    }
}

new Vue({
    render (h) {
         return <ComponentWithData>{data => <span>{data}</span>}</ComponentWithData>
    }
})
```

A couple of things:

1) In my implementation, if an array is passed for children, and any of the children are a function, that will throw away all children, except for the function
2) I understand that there is an API freeze, but this is not breaking any existing APIs, only adding on.
3) Please feel free to reject this specific PR, although if you do, I think this is worthwhile feature to consider.
",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/3710,"['flow/component.js', 'flow/vnode.js', 'src/core/instance/render.js', 'src/core/vdom/helpers.js', 'test/unit/features/component/component-slot.spec.js']",,,"I have implemented this, complete with tests that actually tests things this time (sometimes we need tests for the tests...)

Not entirely happy about the implementation, but I'd like to here your thoughts.
+1 for this feature. It will enable users to write powerful component for abstracting UI pattern and manipulating data rendering.

My concern here is API consistency. 
- Double mustache is for interpolation in vue. Interpolating function is potentially confusing
- Function as child only works well in render function. In template code, users cannot write code like  `<ComponentWithData>{{ (data) => <span>Hello {{data}}</span>}}</ComponentWithData>`
  because vue does not translate expression.
- Hard to specify to which slot the child function is passed. It is not ideal to pass multiple child functions and to distribute them by the order they are passed.

To my best knowledge, I guess @blocka is inspired by JSX expression. But the problem here is that JSX isn't the default template method.
UPDATE: my original can already be done in Vue2.0. See [POC](https://gist.github.com/HerringtonDarkholme/91bb004e6aa5b545f0893fdc2d8c4538) here. Working repo [here](https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme/vue-loader-test/).

My idea is introducing a new builtin component: `template`. A `template` component can declare new variable in its scope. It looks like Angular2's structural directive, sorry for that but I cannot come up with better API. It is compiled into a function that return vnodes. Allowing function for child is the common goal.

``` html
<component-with-data>
  <template let-data slot=""mySlot"">
     <span>Hello {{data}}</span>
  </template>
</component-with-data>
```

Compiled to render function

``` javascript
_h('component-with-data', _tpl('mySlot', function(data) {
  return _h('span', data);
}));
```

Because template is a tag, it works like other tags and would not introduce new behavior to interpolation. 

It works in vue's template code. And for render function, users can just pass a function as default child function, or passing `_tpl` for named slot. For JSX usage in render function, content in template will be compiled to normal vnode rather than functions so users cannot use it. This is confusing for JSX users, indeed.

Adding a slot mark on template tag is easy. The `slot` name may need changed so it does not break `$slot`'s type consistency.

Bike shedding is never enough for introducing an important feature like child function in vue. Looking forward to your feedback.

---

I think I can already do this in vue 2.0.

helper definition

``` javascript
Vue.component('v-template', {
  created() {
    this.$options.render = h => h('')
  }
})
```

component definition:

``` javascript
var printTwice = {
  render(h) {
    let template = this.$slots['default'][0].data.inlineTemplate
    return  h('div', [template.render(), template.render()])
  }
}
```

component usage: 

``` vue
<template>
<p>
  Will print twice
  <print-twice>
    <component is=""v-template"" inline-template>
      <span>, hehe, 1231232</span>
    </component>
  </print-twice>
</p>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  components: { printTwice, }
}
</script>
```
Not exactly why you consider this bike shedding. I'm using this in actual production code right now.

I am definitely biased towards JSX. I'm not going to deny that, and this feature would definitely line up with the ""advanced"" features. The render method itself is an ""advanced"" feature, so I'm not expecting anybody to want this feature with templates.

This PR assumes only one function will ever be used, and there is really no reason to have more then one. A function can always pass in more functions that can be used for ""named"" slots.

That said, the ultimate motivation behind this is the inflexibility of slots. Perhaps we can just modify slots they always functions, and we can pass them properties.

```
// Child
<div slot=""myslot"">
  {{data_passed_in}}
</div>

// Parent 
<template>
<slot name=""myslot"" :data_passed_in=""Hello, World""></slot>
</template> 
```

Which would compile to

```
render (h) {
    return this.$slots.myslot({data_passed_in: ""Hello, World""})
}
```

My two problems with this are the injected variables are not explicit, and, of course, would break the current APIs.
Hey, just a note I'm not leaving this hanging - will probably be part of 2.1 along with a template slot equivalent, thanks for the patience!

fergaldoyle,3709,,Allow setting of compiled render functions via template option,closed,2016-09-20,"In scenarios where we have pre-compiled templates, `compiler.compileToFunctions()`, you need to set both `render` and `staticRenderFns` in component options or use a mixin.

This PR creates a shortcut, by allowing the `template` option receive an object of complied functions.

In conjunction with something like https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-template-compiler-loader, the following would be possible (where the imported template is pre-compiled and not a string):

``` javascript
new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    template: require('./template.html')
})
```

or

``` javascript
import template from './component-a.html'
new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    template
})

Actually you can just do:

``` js
import render from './component-a.html'

new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    ...render
})
```
I found that just setting the `render` function without `staticRenderFns` lead to errors...

I assumed you needed both?
e.g. a template of `<div></div>` while generate this object:

```
{
  render: function(){with(this){return _m(0)}},
  staticRenderFns: [function(){with(this){return _h('div')}}]
}
```

Setting just `render` will give error: `TypeError: this._staticTrees is null`
@fergaldoyle You may have missed the object spread operator `...`  ;)

``` js
new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    // note the ... here, it will spread the `render` object and add its properties to the outer object
    ...render 
})
```

So Evan's idea was that you can make `import render from './component-a.html'` give you an object that is 

``` js
{
  render: function(){ /*omitted*/ },
  staticRenderFns: [ /*omitted*/ ]
}
```

So after the spread you will have

``` js
new Vue({
    el: '#app',
    render: function(){ /*omitted*/ },
    staticRenderFns: [ /*omitted*/ ]
})
```
Thanks, I did miss that. (Also needed to install `transform-object-rest-spread` plugin for Babel).

I'm happy with that approach and for this PR to be closed.

I have used it locally. There are some issues that block the adoption I think...
1. no [`typings`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html) field in package.json. Users have to install type definition one more time. This can be easily fixed.
2. `export = Vue` in index.d.ts actually does not work for TypeScirpt's module resolution. This is the hard part.

For point1 adding a new field is enough. But point2 needs more elaboration.
Vue exposes `Vue` as a whole for API consumer. It is good for non-ES6 module users but in ES6 the _correct_ way to import is `import * as Vue from ""vue""`. (Babel support this by `_interopRequireDefault` helper function)

TS cannot export a class as a whole.  The workaround hack is `export = Vue` as submitted in this PR, but [the exported symbol must be a namespace](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5073) or merged with namespace declaration.  This is by design, I don't think there is much chance to be changed in TS/ES.
One workaround is changin `index.d.ts` to this

``` typescript
import {Vue as _V} from './vue'
declare class Vue extends _V {}
declare namespace Vue {}
export = Vue
```

`declare namespace` statement is for bypassing export limitation.

`declare class Vue extends _V`  is solely for bypassing import limitation in TS module declaration.

This is hideous hack, and TS users must `import * as Vue from ""vue""`, lame. But limits changes in TS specific files.

Another way is adding two private fields to Vue:  `default` pointing to `Vue` itself and `__esModule` being `true`.
This change is compatible with ES5/commonJS/ES6/Babel/TypeScript, and probably future proof. Everyone shall be happy. And TS users can just `import Vue from ""vue""`, cool.
But the change needs to be applied to Vue itself.

What's your opinions? @yyx990803 @kaorun343 @ktsn 
I think changing index.d.ts is better solution because it can clearly separate the code for adapting Vue's implementation in that file.
If we can insert `module.exports.default = Vue` and `module.exports.__esModule = true` on _build time_, I think it's also good.
@ktsn You mean change something in Babel preset to support `module.exports.default = Vue`? https://github.com/yyx990803/babel-preset-es2015-rollup-vue

~~after lengthy web search I think TS users should forget import default and just pay taxes for type checking~~
@HerringtonDarkholme 
Yes, or rollup plugin. But I'm not sure whether such plugin is exist or not.
Probably updating d.ts is realistic. :wink: 
This is so nice to have d.ts files in the npm packages (for all central components), I really like the way things a going for Vue, I still miss my constructor for classes, to make TS nicer to dance with :-)

But my real issue are, how will a render function look like ? I like to use the new VNode system, from Typescript, but I cant seem to find the prototype anymore (found it in rc7).

Also, has anyone tried to use TSX in any of the modes ? 
@druppy Thanks for supporting vue. But github issues are mainly for bug report/ feature request. And please file relevant reviews under a pull request.

You can ask question in gitter and forum. And you may also find https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue helpful.
","Actually, these methods are deprecated on 2.0. We can just remove them.
I think we no longer need namespaces for declarations because we can use external module definition format.
Instead of this, I think it would be better to separate files and import the types as needed.
`[key: string]: any` is dangerous to put this place because all keys will be allowed for component option.
If you intend to allow plugins to extend component option, I think it should be defined in the plugins declaration.
We can use [module argumentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/6213) for this usage.
Directives no longer have instances and we don't need this `[key: string]: any;` :smiley: 
ComputedOptions may have `cache: boolean` property. And all options are optional.
In 2.0, Vue.set can also set array items.
https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/next/src/core/observer/index.js#L190
So, we can define this method as...

``` js
static set<T>(object: Object, key: string, value: T): T;
static set<T>(array: T[], key: number, value: T): T;
```
It seems `init` is changed to `beforeCreated`. https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/2873
I might be wrong, but is it desirable to mark `VNodeDirective`'s field as `readonly`, according to the [doc](https://rc.vuejs.org/guide/custom-directive.html#Directive-Hook-Arguments)
It seems extend should return `typeof Vue`. https://rc.vuejs.org/api/#Vue-extend
``` typescript
interface ComponentOptions {
  functional?: boolean;
  render?(createElement: typeof Vue.prototype.$createElement: context: ContextObject): VNode;
}
interface ContextObject {
  readonly props: any;
  readonly children: VNode[];
  readonly slots: any;
  readonly data: any;
  readonly parent: VNode;
}
```
Maybe a union type is suitable for ComponentOptions? One for functional component and another for normal components.

Also `render` can be even more strict if it is  typed like `render(this: never, createElement: typeof Vue.prototype.$createElement, content: ContextObject)`. So users cannot access `this` in functional components.
It's nice to make like `FunctionalComponentOptions`. This interface will tell us what properties are available / disable for functional components (Probably, lifecycle hooks and `data` are not available).

vird,3227,,hotreload hook,closed,2016-07-05,,https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/3227,['src/util/options.js'],,,"What's the use case for this? A normal component should not be concerned with how it's hot-reloaded.
I have some complex component with many subcomponents. I need hidden textarea for input capturing. I create root component with textarea. I need clicks on any subcomponent lead to focus on this textarea. I don't want seek local root component with $parent walking and seeking for magic property.
So I create single object (shared controller) with focus method. So I handle all clicks with some action and maintain focus on textarea.
Now hotreload comes. It triggers rerender of root component and after that replaces state with old one. old state includes old textarea reference.
I think the problem is that you are placing the textarea reference in your component state. Component state should be pure serializable data. The textarea reference doesn't need to be in the state. You can just attach it to the instance in the `ready` hook with `this.sharedController = ...`.
`You can just attach it to the instance in the ready hook with this.sharedController = ....`
No, I can't, because after 'ready' method comes state replace from hotreload.
Do not define `sharedController` inside `data` at all, then it won't be replaced. It's just a normal property on the Vue instance.
I have complex app with multiple editors. I don't know exact count of components. I can bootstrap Vuejs as separate app, but it breaks idea of vuejs components, because now it's two types of components: native vuejs and bootstraping with sharedController provided in props.
I don't think I understand your last comment and how it relates to the solution I suggested. But to be concise, your `sharedController` doesn't need to be defined in `data`. Just do:

``` js
created () {
  this.sharedController = sharedController
}
```

If this doesn't work due to other constraints, then you didn't provide enough context. Either way, this should not be solved by adding a hotreload hook.
Ok. Let's make it simplier.
sharedController is just mediator. It recieves 'focus' messages from all complex component. I need make actual textarea focused when 'focus' event occur.
What happens when I init app.
I need somehow told sharedController what to do on 'focus' event. So I provide closure with actual reference to textarea. All works ok.
Hotreload comes.
New component tree created with new sharedController. All is ok: new tree with new sharedController, old with old one. Ready hook comes. I told new sharedController what to do on 'focus' event.
Now hotreload replaces all my state in new component with old sharedController. How **old** sharedController (from previous state) should be updated? There are no events after hotreload updates state.
Did you understand my suggestion? `sharedController` is not part of the state if you avoid declaring it in `data`.
Hm. It works, but it's kind'a injecting in component. I can accidently replace some important property. I suggested that there is only several safe spaces for state: data, props. 
I tested some time solution with 'created' method. I've found that it works only in this simple case, that I mentioned above.
I have another case, when hotreload hook is much simpler.
I have some two types of components
1. Complex structure DOM-based component with one hidden textarea that capture all keyboard activity
2. Simple canvas-based component with hidden textarea.
I have component for multiple keyboard scheme handling. Problem 1. Current scheme is a state. After hot reload I will be switched to default scheme.
Ok. I extend keyboard_controller for different components with actions specific to that component. Actions could be result of keyboard actions or mouse actions.
So I want handle all mouse events with that controller. Problem 2. Canvas must be pannable, so I must store offset_x, offset_y between hot reloads.

So, I have two solutions:
1. Without hotreload hook. I must make state detachable from controller, because state must preserve with hot reload. After 'ready' I must setTimeout for waiting hotreload applies. Now data has old state, I can attach this state to controller and call update, that would redraw all canvas contents to actual state (not clean canvas, but with elements, pan, other state before hotreload)
2. With hotreload hook. Just update textarea, canvas reference. Then call update.

Pros:
1. If error occurs in hotreload hook, page would be reloaded, due hotreload exception catch logic, not my custom.
2. setTimeout/setImmediate not guarantee that no changes occur between 'ready' and after hotreload, so external data feed can easily break the state. Hotreload hook is sync.
3. I can organize code as I want, framework not limits me.
4. (almost impossible case) It's stable if hotreload would be async and setTimeout would be fired before state replace.

Cons:
1. If controller initialization is long, I want no new controller created at all, so I want fully different path of hooks for hotreload and typical create. It's too much changes and can be fragile.

pure regex based approach is a somewhat incomplete fix. For example it would fail for this:

``` js
abc | filter {a:1} {b:2}
```

It would match `{a:1} {b:2}` as a single argument.

Additionally, if we support spaces inside object braces, they should probably work for arrays too:

``` js
abc | filter [1, { a: 2 }]
```

So we either support the full syntax, or not support it at all. A more proper parsing logic would have to do something similar to what the directive parser is doing: keeping track of braces/brackets/quotes state and only delimit an argument if we are not in any pairs.
Fortunately in 2.0 we don't have this issue :o
So maybe we should just drop it and recommend to pass a computed property instead?
@yyx990803 I agree. This isn't proper fix then. I'll see what I can do about it :)
@yyx990803 I was playing around a bit more and come up with new syntax when filter has multiple arguments. If there are more filters they need to be wrapped in `[]` as you can see in spec. I'm not sure if this is the way we want to do it...especially with eval used üòä . 

This also forces us to document this behavior and update the docs/guide. I can do it, if this is the way we want to handle this, otherwise I think it's better we just document you should extract filters to functions or use no spaces like @posva already mentioned :)
We forgot about this. I'll rather keep it the way it is and add some documentation that adding a new syntax to filters which already use a special (non-js) syntax
Can this be closed now? I haven't followed well enough @zigomir

simplesmiler,3136,,Fix watcher target not resetting properly,closed,2016-06-22,"Possible fix for https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/3133.

The problem appears to be rooted in [`prevTarget`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.0.0-alpha.5/src/core/observer/watcher.js#L15) getting funky [during instance mounting](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.0.0-alpha.5/src/core/instance/lifecycle.js#L53).

This is most likely not the best solution. Maybe a better place for solution would be around [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.0.0-alpha.5/src/core/instance/lifecycle.js#L54) or [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.0.0-alpha.5/src/core/observer/watcher.js#L77).

Also I can't come up with a better unit test than the original repro:
- Create two instances, first with a computed property (easiest way to reproduce), make sure computed field is used in the template,
- Change the data of the second instance,
- Make sure that first instance didn't update.

That David Walsh article indicates that should this feature be accepted that there should probably be documentation stating to be careful when handling events in libraries intended for distribution.
Thanks for the PR, but I am somehow not in favor of this, because there is no corresponding semantics in the native DOM event API.

Took me some time to respond this because I am not really a fan of this proposal but it wasn't immediately clear to me what turned me off. I tried it out and it just felt weird to me:

``` html
<comp :a :b></comp>
```

Now I realize it's because of the semantic implication of HTML attributes that have no values - they are usually boolean attributes. An attribute with no value indicates the ""presence of an attribute"" or ""truthiness"". Implicitly expanding to a binding overloads this perception.

In addition - if a prop in the child component is declared with type `Boolean`, the presence of the attribute indicates a true value. This would cause `prop` and `:prop` to have very different meanings, and is technically a breaking change.
Forgot to mention though - thanks to both @phanan and @bopjesvla for taking a stab at implementing this. Appreciate your effort and sorry for the late response.

Thanks for your answer :)

Well, I'm pretty sure it's me not understanding this correctly or missing something. The [created hook](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/2871/commits/1706ad3b7d8442be781883afae0142ab5d3054c0#diff-16cdbc0c23582da9088930a897ce0e93R18) fires on the client-side, which means the basic setup should be working. I expected `$data` to be populated with [what I set on the server](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/2871/commits/1706ad3b7d8442be781883afae0142ab5d3054c0#diff-a3310005786536aaf72e324eef49cee7R72), but it is `undefined`. (in the current state of the code I tried to set `data` in the app.js, but you can ignore that)

The currentBranch binding also does not seem to work, as changes do not trigger the watch ‚Äì¬†but as I said, I guess t is just me doing something wrong here. That's why I'd be really thankful if you could provide some guidance or point me to the right places in the vue code or test, so I can dig around for myself... even though this is early stage I'd like to get this to work and provide an example others could use to figure out, how ssr and hydration will work :)

Thanks again!

P.S.: In case you would like to try the example, start the server with `node run.js` in the commits-ssr example directory.
Thanks to @moerssl I got it working now - as I guessed it was just me not understanding fully how it is supposed to work. I'll close this PR for now as we have extracted the example into a separate repository, which can be found at https://github.com/dennisreimann/vue-spike :)

You're right, that's the rawValue. My bad!

Jinjiang,2854,,[next][advice]new render mechanism,closed,2016-05-11,"In web the best practise of first time rendering is just append the whole dom tree once into the body. But in some other virtual dom situation like mobile web or native app, the first time rendering is not as fast as users' expectation. So I tried to make ""a little"" change to implement ""stream rendering"" to optimize the first-screen perf. And let it be able to append the whole dom tree either once or node-by-node:
1. changed `__h__(tag, data, children)` into `__r__(__s__(tag, data), children)` so the parent node could be calculate->generate->append first and the children later.
2. supported `stream: true` option and added a new `__stream_patch__` method besides `__patch__` to optimize the first-time rendering logic. If no `stream: true` option set, just render as normal before.
3. supported `atom: true` in `vnode.data` to describe whether this node will be appended with its children together as a atom or child-by-child in ""stream rendering"" mode.

Additionally, I changed the `class`/`staticClass` from string to array and added an object `staticStyle` for better virtual dom control.

We should split them into smaller PRs, each addressing a specific issue.

Also re streaming mode: since this feature is very platform-specific, I wonder if it's possible to implement it in a less intrusive / more decoupled fashion. The concern is that these features will mostly be used for weex, but weex itself doesn't live in this repo, so coordinating changes between the two projects will become problematic in the long run.

Ideally, weex-specific feature requirements should live in weex and should be able to be iterated on without relying on Vue core to pull in the changes. One possible approach to achieve that is implementing the minimal changes required in core to expose an interface that allows a platform to customize the patching/codegen process. That might be difficult in the short term, but this patch as it is just seems to be coupling the two projects too much with serious maintenance cost.
Yes your concern is true. My point is that there is no way to get streaming mode based on `__h__`. I can try to make another smaller pr to use `__r__` & `__s__` only but no streaming mode and atom option.

Another thing I think the `class` & `style` process is too tricky for web, not general enough. So another small discuss or pr will be made later.
We have recently introduced a VUE_ENV environment variable. You may be able
to aid support for this by using this.

This way we can opitimize the build to use cases. As Evan said this is
aimed mainly to Weex or other native code implementations, so being able to
target the functionality may be of favour.

@yyx990803 Tell me your thoughts on this. I'm willing to keep working on the issue because it's interesting :smile: 
`v-show` and `v-if` both check its `elseEl` separately, that might be something not dry...

How about making `v-else` a separated directive and assign it the duty to check for previous `v-show` and `v-if` 
@Twiknight hmm, in that case `v-else` would have to reintegrate the behaviour of `v-if` and `v-show`. The problem would however be the same (about the component directive not respecting priority)
@posva Yes,you're right, `v-if` and `v-show` acts somehow differently..

Maybe we can simply replace `v-else` with its previous tag at compile time?  
Thus we don't need to consider which tag `v-else` is following at run time.
@Twiknight Yes, although it won't solve the issue about `v-show` either :sweat_smile: 
Unfortunately this fix doesn't fix the issue when the `v-show`'s value is `true` on first render (both branches are shown). I'll take a look to see if there's a better way to handle this.
I thought that optimisation was only written for the `if` directive.

Hey @rowanwins - apologies for letting this PR hang for so long.

In v2, `attached` and `detached` are indeed no longer supported. This is mainly due to their usefulness not justifying the amount of complexity in ensuring correct behavior for these hooks. Given that, `beforeAttach` and `beforeDetach` obviously are not needed as well.

For v1, it would be less than ideal to introduce two hooks that are soon to be gone in v2, so unfortunately that means we will probably have to let this PR go. I know you've put a lot of work into it, so I do want to thank you for that and say sorry ;'(

@rowanwins @posva hey! Should I add the hook into the docs?
Hey @rowanwins - thank you very much for the PR.

The attach/detach hooks are a bit more complicated than it seems. In particular:
- Fragments (the partial compilation construct used internally by `v-for` and `v-if`) also needs to call attach/detach for components contained inside it: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/fragment/fragment.js
- lifecycle hooks need proper merging strategy to be defined in [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/util/options.js#L122-L139)
- we also need the `beforeAttach` counterpart.

Of course this is probably larger than the scope you created this PR for - if you are up for implementing the whole thing, great! But it's absolutely fine if you feel it's too much for you to take on, we can get this specific PR merged and work on top of your improvements :)
Thanks for the comprehensive feedback @yyx990803 , I've had a go at incorporating all your suggestions and it looks like I've even managed to get the tests passing!

Nice! Yes 1 commit would be ideal - you can actually just reset/squash into 1 commit and then force push - it will update this PR.

@fullfs That'd be great!

","no need for the if check here - `_callHook` would be a no-op if the hook does not exist.
Also the hook name should be `beforeDetach` (as in `beforeDestroy` and `destroyed`)
this line is not needed because hooks are already called by `_callHook`
should be `child._callHook('beforeDetach')` here.

Thanks for the PR. The jsdoc is indeed wrong
@jbrooksuk What is the use case for displaying 0, 1 or more than 2 decimals on a currency?
> @jbrooksuk What is the use case for displaying 0, 1 or more than 2 decimals on a currency?

@posva mainly it's just when you have a more precise number but need to display it differently.
@jbrooksuk I see the concern on arbitrary numbers but what about currencies?
> @jbrooksuk I see the concern on arbitrary numbers but what about currencies?

When you don't want the trailing "".00"" on the end. At least in $ and ¬£ you tend to display ¬£99.00 as ¬£99
@posva @jbrooksuk What about instead of an option to specify decimal places, having an option to display whole numbers without decimals? So for example in USD, `22` would become `""$22""`, but `22.2` would become `""$22.20""`. That way, you can guarantee you're not hiding rounding errors or other miscalculations.
Perhaps a boolean such as `preferIntegers`?
@jbrooksuk @posva  I believe your concern is valid for removing trailing '.00'.

For inspiration: Angular provides a similar parameter called _fractionSize_ on their currency filter which you can reference here: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/currency

@chrisvfritz In that case an optional flag to the currency filter such as _no_trailing_zeros_ could be an option.
> @posva @jbrooksuk What about instead of an option to specify decimal places, having an option to display whole numbers without decimals? So for example in USD, 22 would become ""$22"", but 22.2 would become ""$22.20"". That way, you can guarantee you're not hiding rounding errors or other miscalculations.

@chrisvfritz that doesn't work in some scenarios. For example, the app I'm building needs to display the whole price, not the pence, but elsewhere it needs the pence.
Remember that this is an optional parameter and the default behaviour continues to be the same. I feel this adds more flexibility.
@jbrooksuk So in some cases there is a non-zero pence in the price, but you still prefer to hide it?
> @jbrooksuk So in some cases there is a non-zero pence in the price, but you still prefer to hide it?

Yeah, and without re-implementing the filter, it's not ""impossible"". Like I said, this is an _optional_ extension of existing functionality. It's just not strict anymore.
@FadyMak I like the `noTrailingZeroes` name! :smiley: **Edit: Although it just occurred to me, `$22.20` technically has a trailing zero, so that could be confusing.**

@jbrooksuk Hmm, I worry that might be an edge case. I feel like suppressing non-zero pence/cents/etc could very easily (and unintentionally) hide errors in other applications, as people might use it hoping to only suppress trailing zeroes.
> @jbrooksuk Hmm, I worry that might be an edge case. I feel like suppressing non-zero pence/cents/etc could very easily (and unintentionally) hide errors in other applications, as people might use it hoping to only suppress trailing zeroes.

If they do, then that's a matter of not understanding what the filter is doing.
@jbrooksuk I agree, but I think in designing APIs, it's important to be wary of releasing features that are especially _prone_ to misunderstanding. I also have a preference for explicitness though. Since that's a feature that could easily hide rounding/calculation errors, I would want to make sure I (and other team members) remained very aware of that. So I would personally never use such an option even if it existed. I would instead opt for explicitness - with something like a computed value called `priceWithoutPence` that I used the currency filter on instead. And in computing that value, seeing `Math.floor`/`Math.round`/`Math.ceil` would make it more obvious how we were rounding.

What are your thoughts @posva @FadyMak?
@jbrooksuk I agree with the point of being explicit. I believe the core API should provide basic functionality such as specifying the _decimalPlaces_ as an **optional** parameter to the currency filter. This would result in the currency filter rounding to the specified number of decimal places.

Since the number of decimal places varies by locale (i.e.: the US Dollar ($) is usually represented with 2 decimal places whereas the Kuwaiti Dinar (KWD) is represented with 3 decimal places), the **decimalPlaces** parameter would default to the maximum number of decimal places for that specific locale.

Please reference the [ISO 4217 World Currency Format](http://www.thefinancials.com/?SubSectionID=curformat) to see the default number of decimal places a specific currency displays.

If a developer wishes to perform more complex formatting, they can achieve that by defining a custom filter of their own and chaining it to the currency filter. 
Defaulting based on locale could be dangerous?
@FadyMak Good to know about some currencies using 3 decimal places instead of 2 or 0 - thanks for linking to that resource!
I would actually create a precision filter away from this to allow for more use cases,  and chain the filters.  This will help add more to the API at the same time as resolving this issue. 

This filter then should not strip the amount of decimal places. Which will simplify the usage of this filter. 
@jbrooksuk thanks for the PR! So to sum it up:
1. We want to avoid making built-in filters more complex than they are right now, because Vue is not a utility library and domain-specific logic is best left in userland. The default filters were provided for convenience but not for completeness.
2. As @blake-newman suggested, chaining an extra filter seems like a cleaner and smarter solution.

Although we are not merging this, we really appreciate your contribution!
","Pretty sure this is right.
I'd rather call places decimals, but I'm not native English so I prefer someone to confirm or reject this
@posva How about decimalPlaces?
I think that dotPosition or dotPos is also a better name :smile: 
I don't think there is an issue with this name?
There's not, I never heard about places :sweat_smile:, sorry
@chrisvfritz Places seems fine to me
I would use `precision` as the terminology is a bit more precise.  As you are defining the accuracy of the output.

What he wanted can simply be solved by using a CSS class to toggle the element's opacity with CSS transitions.
I asked https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/2382#issuecomment-188131890 because `opacity: 0` and `visibility: hidden` do not produce identical results. Namely, content with `opacity: 0` is interactive (links and buttons can be clicked, inputs are focusable), while content with `visibility: hidden` is not.

`opacity: 0; pointer-events: none` produces similar result to `visibility: hidden`, but only works in IE11+.

Thus I believe a directive for toggling `visibility` instead of `display` is handy, either in core or in ecosystem.
Ah I got you. I was just thinking in terms of getting the transitions right. Honestly I was just kind of bored and wanted to see if I can do it! 
@simplesmiler ah that's true. That's why I exposed the transition API though. With that you can easily write your own `v-visible` directive.

This pull request provides an alternate implementation of `Function` based on node.js `vm` module when the native `Function` doesn't work. These changes make _Vue_ work fine on Atom (and similar node.js based environment that may have forbidden `new Function()`)

I ran browserify and webpack over the modified project, so far it doesn't break.

EDIT: I saw the csp-compliant build, which works on Atom as well, but when available, the `vm` based implementation may be more efficient than `notevil.Function`.

Well, still having issues. I will look into what I have broken -_-. Stay tuned.
On my side the modified `vue.js` still works just fine in the browser. Not sure if we should worry about the failed tests, that are skipped in the `dev` branch. Should we?
I might have misunderstood purpose of this PR, but.. have you checked **csp** branch? https://github.com/vuejs/vue/releases/tag/v1.0.11-csp
Yes thanks! Just edited the first post of this PR: I did see the **csp** branch, but the `vm` based implementation, when available (node.js/atom) should be more efficient than parsing AST with pure javascript.

Using `vm.runInThisContext` (it's what `loophole` is doing) will create a first class js function _vs_ evaluating AST at every call. I am wondering if it could be considered to use it in that case?
Thanks for this PR, but I don't think this should be part of the main distributed build of Vue.

On the other hand, the advantage of CSP build is that it can be used in environments that enforces CSP but do not have a Node runtime (e.g. Chrome apps).

It may indeed be the most efficient solution in Electron-based environments like Atom. But that's a really narrow use case. I think this could either be used as a fork or a special branch like `vm`.
Yes, makes sense.

The `vm` branch might be a good option (also to be able to do something like `npm install vue@vm`).

I guess for now I will use a fork.

Thanks for the feedback!

I'm afraid this should be left to the user/contributor then. This seems simple enough to add it ad-hoc and it doesn't make sense to add config files for every possible IDE out there.

Please note that Vue.js core intentionally limits the functionality it provides to keep its size small. Therefore we only provide the most commonly-used filter functions as default ones. If the users need a highly custom sorting algorithm, they can just implement it as a custom filter or a computed property.

The basic idea is, we want avoid shipping code that adds size but only get used in a few very specific scenarios. So unfortunately I don't think we should add yet another sorting filter.

Additionally, please make sure to follow the code style and pass the lint/test build flow before submitting PRs.

Should I use the `Cache` ?

No, what I mean is just hold it in a variable outside the function as `var hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`

@MicroDreamIT please ask this question at Vue chat: https://gitter.im/vuejs/vue
","I think splitting this here makes the code harder to follow. It's ok that this check stay in the watcher.
Not sure about the method name here. There's no ""bubbling"" here - maybe something like `syncChanges`?
Yep, you're right.
It's more about responsibilities, IMO. Written this way, misc.js mixin is responsible for both forward and reverse filters, and abstracts forContext existence from the watcher.

Also, `alias === expression` does not look nice (because I easily bypassed this logic in my initial fiddle), so the logic will probably grow and I definitely don't want to put it to watcher (because it is not its responsibility) or for directive (to keep reverse filtering logic reusable just for a case). Any ideas?
When I saw `scope._bubbleChanges` it's a bit confusing, because this is a v-for-scope-only thing, but is attached to Vue's prototype, which imo is the wrong place. It only works because of the prototypal inheritance.
As for expression check - a reverse write should be applied as long as the expression starts with the alias. e.g. `item.test` and `item[test]` both should trigger reverse write. So you need a regular expression, e.g. `new RegExp(alias + '\\b')`. To be more efficient we might want to construct this regex right when we parse the alias in `v-for`.

nkovacs,1285,,Add mixed type properties.,closed,2015-09-09,"Literal property auto-casting now respects property type(s),
and will not cast a property to boolean or number if it
cannot be a boolean or number.

Fixes #1284, #1148 

There were a few special cases that are a bit different for mixed types, but it should be backwards compatible:
- `default` will always be called even if one of the types is `Function`. But if the only type is `Function`, it won't be called, like before. In practice it probably doesn't makes sense to have a property that can be either a Function or something else.
- If the default is not specified and the property is omitted, the default is undefined, except for Boolean, where it is false. For a mixed type, the default will be undefined even if one of the possible types is Boolean. It might make sense to use false as the default here, but in practice both are falsy, and you can specify a default, so it's not a big issue.
- In contrast to the previous point, if one of the possible types is Boolean (explicitly specified), and the attribute value is omitted (or is an empty string), it will be cast to true, even if String is also an accepted type for the property. This is how it worked previously for Boolean type properties, so I extended that to mixed properties that include Boolean. It made more sense for a property without a value to be true in this case, instead of a falsy empty string.

For example:

```
prop1: [Boolean, String]
prop2: String

<example></example> <!-- undefined undefined -->
<example prop1 prop2></example> <!-- true, '' -->
<example prop1=""foo"" prop2=""foo""></example> <!-- 'foo' 'foo' -->
<example prop1=""123"" prop2=""123""></example> <!-- '123' '123' -->
```

Literal values are always strings; boolean and number literals need to be passed via dynamic bindings. The only auto-cast case is omitted value for Boolean props.

The ability to allow multiple types is a good improvement, but I think that should itself be a PR. Also, I somewhat prefer only auto-casting omitted value when Boolean is the only expected type.
>  with 1.0.0's syntax there's no longer the need for auto casting

Why not? For example with `<example prop=""123""></example>`, if prop's type is just Number, there's no harm in auto-casting it. Not auto-casting would mean this would not pass validation, and require people to use binding, even though they're not binding to a variable. That feels like a workaround for a bug to me.
Similarly, if the type is [Number, String, Boolean], the user has opted into it, so auto-casting would not cause surprise.
You could disable auto-casting when the type is not specified, but I kept it enabled for backwards compatibility, and because you said in #1148 that most people expect auto-casting.

> I somewhat prefer only auto-casting omitted value when Boolean is the only expected type

What about when the type is [Boolean, Number]? Empty string isn't allowed there, so it makes sense to  cast to true.
The alternative is to auto-cast to true if Boolean is an allowed type, unless String is also an allowed type. But I think it's simpler and more consistent to always auto-cast to true if Boolean is a possible type.
In 1.0.0 `prop=""123""` is a literal, thus it is expected to pass ""123"" as a literal string. If we do autocast, the user would have to do `bind-prop=""'123'""` in order to pass the string, which is less intuitive imo. ""Literal syntax = string"" is a much easier rule to remember.

I'd like to treat multiple types as ""any one of these types is allowed"". Omitting value = true is a behavior that is strongly tied to boolean attributes only - if the user wants to use this syntax, then the prop needs to be Boolean and Boolean only. Casting it when multiple types are allowed only makes the rules more complicated than necessary.
> If we do autocast, the user would have to do bind-prop=""'123'"" in order to pass the string, which is less intuitive imo.

Not if the property's type is just String. This would also mean you could never use literals with Number or Boolean properties, it would always fail validation.

The only case where the value is ambiguous is with mixed properties that include String, e.g. `[String, Number]` - should it auto-cast to Number or not? I'm in favor of auto-casting, since you opted into it, and you probably don't want something that looks like a number to be a string if you explicitly said that you accept a number.

For type=null, I could change it to treat it as `[String]` instead of the current backwards compatible behavior. That way by default literal properties would always be strings, and you'd have to opt into casting.

>  Omitting value = true is a behavior that is strongly tied to boolean attributes only - if the user wants to use this syntax, then the prop needs to be Boolean and Boolean only.

If the type doesn't include String, the empty string will create an error, so you can't omit the value. It's an unnecessary restriction. 
For example:

``` js
props: {
  centered: {
    type: [Number, Boolean]
    default: false // not centered by default
  }
}
```

``` html
<column centered></column> <!-- centered === true, i.e. use default width -->
<column centered=""3""></column> <!-- centered === 3, explicit width -->
<column></column> <!-- centered === false -->
```

Also this doesn't happen for type=null, so you have to opt into it by listing Boolean as one of the possible values.
The only ambiguity is with `[String, Boolean]` and such, but you can look at that from both sides, for example:

``` html
<example highlighted></example> <!-- use default highlighting -->
<example highlighted=""true""></example> <!-- use default highlighting -->
<example highlighted=""green""></example> <!-- use green highlighting -->
<example></example> <!-- no highlighting -->
```

If empty string is not cast to true, in this case, the first example would be `'' == false` which is wrong.

A possible solution is to allow the property to specify the value for when the value is empty, e.g.:

``` js
props: {
  highlighted: {
    type: [String, Boolean],
    default: false,
    empty: true,
    validator: function(value) {
      // only allow predefined colors
      return [""green"", ""blue"", ""red"", true, false].indexOf(value) !== -1;
    }
  }
}
```
The issue I have with your proposal is that the same syntax, e.g. `prop=""123""`, will result in different values based on the component's prop type expectations. The consumer of the component will need to understand these complex conversion rules (A only gets casted into B when the props expects type A & B together...) in order to infer what eventual value something will be casted into.

In comparison, a simpler rule set is:
1. `prop=""xxx""`: always a string.
2. `:prop=""xxx""`: always an expression. `123`, `true` and `false` should use this as well.
3. `prop`: only true when the type is boolean. A special case, but makes sense and easy to tell.
That's true. But I don't think it's a big problem, you already have to know what the component expects when you're using it, so that you don't try to pass a number in a literal property.
The only uncertainty occurs when you're reading a template and you don't know the component's property rules.
Anyway, I can't remove the auto-casting from this, since that would break the expected behavior in 0.12. I'll rework the pull request for 1.0

VladimirShestakov,1203,,Added namespaces for events,closed,2015-08-25,,https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/1203,"['src/api/events.js', 'src/observer/index.js', 'test/unit/specs/api/events_spec.js']",,,"We can dispatch, broadcast and emit event with namespaces:

``` js
this.$on('name', function(...)); // work for all namespaces
this.$on('name.xxx', function(...)); // work
this.$on('name.xxx.yyy', function(...)); // not work, because need yyy
```
In the listener we have access to the all namespaces by this._eventNamespaces

``` js
this.$on('name', function(
    if (this._eventNamespaces.indexOf('xxx')!==-1){
         console.log('is xxx');
    };
));

``
```
Thanks for the PR, but I don't think this design is intuitive enough... what problem does it solve? Looks like I can achieve something similar with current API:

``` js
this.$on('namespace', function (type) {
  switch (type) {
    // ...
  }
})

this.$emit('namespace', 'xxx')
this.$emit('namespace', 'yyy')
```
But you used similarity of namespace for lifecycle events (hooks). Namespaces make modular system more flexible for routing/listening events. They are used in the largest applications with many vendor components. Later we can improve core behavior of the Vue with namespaces.
It might be better to use "":"" instead of ""."" for names splitting. Because "":"" is used in the core (hook:created, hook:compiled, ...)
And I would like to add a listener of all events by an empty string (name):

``` js
this.$on('', function () {
    console.log('all events');
});
```

This listener can be used in the root component for broadcasting all events dispatched from the children
Overall I think event communication is something I want to de-emphasize for new users, because it is too easy to be abused and create hard-to-maintain situations. In the future the recommendation would be adopting a flux-like architecture for large apps, and only use events in small use cases for convenience. Making it more powerful/complicated doesn't fit with that vision. Thanks for the PR though.
It's not good idea to make analog of ReactJS.

Thanks for the PR, but let me explain why I don't want to add `v-hide`: the general philosophy behind Vue is we want to keep it as lightweight as possible, so when we add code into the codebase, we want to make sure the code either provides substantial improvement to an existing feature, or adds a new functionality that cannot be trivially achieved with the current API. In general, we want to avoid adding code just for the sake of stylistic alternatives. In fact we have been trying to removing stylistic alternatives as much as possible (e.g. `v-with` vs `props`).

`v-hide`, in my opinion, is just a stylistic alternative to `v-show`, and its benefit over `v-show` is somehow subjective and marginal.

True, months ago it was the opposite :)

rrrene,705,,Add docs badge to README,closed,2015-02-06,"Hi Evan,

I want to propose to add this badge to the README to show off inline-documentation: [![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/yyx990803/vue.svg)](http://inch-ci.org/github/yyx990803/vue)

The badge links to [Inch CI](http://inch-ci.org) and shows an evaluation by [InchJS](http://trivelop.de/inchjs), a project that tries to raise the visibility of inline-docs. Besides testing and other coverage, documenting your code is often neglected although it is a very engaging part of Open Source.

So far over 500 **Ruby** projects are sporting these badges to raise awareness for the importance of inline-docs and to show potential contributors that they can expect a certain level of code documentation when they dive into your project's code and motivate them to eventually document their own.

I would really like to do the same for the **JavaScript** community and roll out support for JS over the coming weeks (early adopters are [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever), [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and [Shipit](https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit)).

Although this is ""only"" a passion project, I really would like to hear your thoughts, critique and suggestions. Your status page is http://inch-ci.org/github/yyx990803/vue

Yeah, as mentioned, Inch is still learning. And you should by no means have to change your source to accomodate a tool!

Could you point me to some of the ""a lot of inline docs"" that are missed? because a cursory look at the source yielded no false-positives regarding ""is documented but detected as undocumented"".
For example, the first item in ""not documented"" was `apply` in transition module, which is exported and also have a function name:

``` js
exports.apply = function apply () {
  //...
}
```

Also, I put variables that are only used for a single function right above that function's signature, after the comments for that function. This also gets flagged as ""undocumented"".

All this change does is make the model populated by the element's File array in element.files, so then you can use FileReader or whatever else to get the contents of the file that was marked for uploading, including it's size and filename and path.
",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/683,['src/directives/model/default.js'],,,"in the meanwhile, my workaround is:

1) add a `v-el` to your input: `<input v-el='myfileinput' type='file'>`
2) add this to your viewmodel: `compiled: function() var self = this; this.$$.myfileinput.onchange = function(e) { self.files = self.$$.myfileinput.files; }`
3) then you can access `files` on your model to get the files array
Sorry for leaving this one hanging for so long - we will likely revisit input[type=""file""] handling post 1.0, so closing this.
","It should be noted that `el.files` is a `FileList` object which is array-like, but not really an array (thus when stringifying it looks different from a stringified array). The items inside are also `File` objects. In theory you should only be putting plain objects in the vm's data, so maybe we need to process `el.files` into a proper array of plain objects here.
Oh, but doing that would make it un-passable to other browser APIs, thus making it useless. I think you are missing the point here. File, Blob, ArrayBuffer... they are all objects that live inside the browser's implementation, and not just a JSON object you can fiddle with. They are native, you can't serialize them.
The point is Vue will try to convert the object properties into getter/setters and they may or may not break these native objects, which we need to test. And if we skip conversion for these objects, they won't be able to be used for data-binding.

there is ajax call during ""created"" event that updates the model (ajax errors are correclty handled)

skovhus,607,,Added v-style support for objects (dev branch),closed,2014-11-30,"`v-style` directive now supports objects, see #578

Why would we set `cssText` if the argument cannot be found in the model?

Say `<span class=""author"" v-style=""color: foo;"">`, where `foo` is not found in the model, then we would update the `styleText` to `color`. Is there a use case for this, or is it a feature that should be removed?
I see that `v-style=""font-size: foo +'px'""` creates a data binding, so when `foo` is updated, the style reflects the change. 

When using an object with `v-style`, then changing properties in the object, the style is not changed. It only works if `foo` is a computed property. It this as expected?
re: no argument - the argument is the plain string before the colon (e.g. `color`). No argument means using it like `v-style=""myCSSString""`. If the value is not an object, it could be a raw inline style string, e.g. `""color: red, width: 100%""`
re: nested properties inside the object - that's something I also overlooked. To track nested properties we need to use a deep watcher, but previously there wasn't an easy interface to do that. I have added a new directive option `deep` in 1bbaab38bdbe53f7ec7e60d33393832eccf47440 so you can add `deep: true` for `v-style` to make it observe nested properties. (Make sure to rebase against latest commit)
But would myCSSString in the Vues data? Or what is the case here?
Do you think it makes sense to make it deep? Or should people just use computed?
If `myCSSString` is not in data, it will be `undefined`. In that case it will simply be considered an empty string by the browser.

Making it deep is fine, since it's easier for the users and the internal perf cost is the same as using computed. Asking them to use computed just for this feature sounds confusing.
But if it is not in data, then I don't see any use case for this...

I will look at doing it deep. Where should make the change?
The user could have deleted the property from the model, in that case we need to remove any existing CSStext.

Making it deep is simply adding `deep: true` in the directive definition. (You need to rebase on top of the latest `dev` branch commit)
I will make the change for deep. Do you like the pull request? 

But still I don't see the use case for CssText... Is it if the property was in data, but was removed?
In the case of

``` html
<span v-style=""spanStyles""></span>
```

`spanStyles` can either be

``` js
// object
{
  color: 'red',
  font-weight: 'bold'
}
```

or

``` js
// plain string
'color: red, font-weight: old'
```

It's just for flexibility's sake.
BTW the PR looks good, once you add `deep: true` and a test case for a nested property triggering update it should be good to merge.
Cool. Thanks for explaining.

Yes, I agree with you. However if somebody use as this way, behavior differs depending on browsers. I feel it is weird, so wrote a patch, but it might be my overthinking...
I appreciate the PR, I'm just not sure if this should be handled by Vue, since the behavior will be different even without Vue.

Yep. The current parser always catches the first `:`. Need to tweak `Directive.parse()` to get around that. Supposedly you should be able to do `v-attr=""'xlink:href': url""` but currently it's not working :/
Thank you for your suggestions.
Now I've implemented @gaydenko's solution.

Yes, I noticed the syntax that uses single quotes (or double quotes).
I like @gaydenko's suggestion, but the quotes style seems to be more useful especially when users write own custom directives.
So I've implemented it too, but I'm not sure that this implementation is along with your intention. See test cases.
@yyx990803 Probably quotes styles mixing  (single and double ones in the same clause) is also slightly disturb that markup cleanness you prefer :) I guess a hash as a directive attribute value - as suggested in the `next` branch - is much more clean.

The comment node is essential for `v-repeat` to work properly. It is not recommended to modify DOM that is already being managed by Vue.

The linked example uses Vue 0.10.5. You need to run it with your modified version to see the problem.
As @dlh pointed out, `v-with` links the parent object and the child's `$data` by reference, so they are sharing the same object. Extending a new copy makes the two out of sync. I'd say the overwriting is expected behavior in this case.
So, what is the best way to create the components with predefined values? how I understand, now it is impossible?
You can either do multiple clause `v-with` to bind individual values from parent, or set values in your child component's `ready` hook.

dyu,187,,allow stop propagation for the handlers that do not receive the event object (dev branch),closed,2014-03-15,"In addition to #161.
",https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/187,"['src/directives/on.js', 'test/unit/specs/misc.js']",,,"I kinda like it, but the return value of an event handler is usually associated with `preventDefault()`. I think a better way to handle this is similar to what Angular does - provides the event as `$event` so you can do `<div v-on=""click:handle('message', $event)"">`
`preventDefault()` would have been fine with the return value but in vue's compiler, only `stopPropagation()` is implemented/overridden.

You kinda like it, I definitely need it :-) (I'm not keen on having to specify the extra $event as the nested handlers don't have access to it)
On second thought, I agree with the extra `$event` arg and it is indeed the better solution (and most flexible, granted that e.preventDefault()/etc works on it)
1b1d72ea5680e29eaa33c1648727dc19857bb8df
Setting useCapture to true triggers the handlers on the parent vm first before the intended vm.
The handler on the intented vm (which contains the event-source-element) should trigger first, as thats expected behavior.
Well it won't because we are executing the callbacks in reverse order they are attached, so child listeners will fire before parent listeners.

Anyway, I did some research regarding event delegation and I'm not sure if it's necessary in the first place. Reverting to a simple addEventListener implementation could simplify a lot of things.
Try running the example below with:
`this.el.addEventListener(event, delegator.handler, true)`
and
`this.el.addEventListener(event, delegator.handler, false)`

Compare the results of both (the latter will render the correct result)
Hint:
Click the elements with the text: `CHILD` and `PARENT`

That's indeed problematic. I've decided to ditch event delegation all together in 423b54dfd41571fe45e7c46d465ad75665dc1b82. Since `v-on` auto unbinds listeners, the benefits of event delegation isn't that significant (and would actually result in slower handler invocation). That makes all handlers work the way they are expected to.
""That makes all handlers work the way they are expected to""
Meaning a handler that returns false translates to e.preventDefault?
Yes, just added a commit that returns the handler's return value from the wrapped handler.
Cool.
Is event delegation for v-repeat removed as well?
That is the area where delegation matters.
You could probably only implement delegation if a handler is nested under a v-repeat.
I've actually thought about it since long ago. Surprisingly, there's little hard evidence that shows any significant performance benefits of event delegation over simple listeners on a huge list. On a huge, huge list, adding the listeners would take more time and memory at boot time, but event delegation makes each event triggered much slower due to the delegation check overhead. It's a tradeoff. In `v-on`'s case, event delegation also adds a lot of complexity in trying to make handlers behave the way people expect them to be, so it no longer seem to be the optimal choice.
On a side note - angular refused to add event delegation to `ng-repeat` for similar reasons.

I think the addition of a `v-control` directive would encourage some less than ideal patterns.
@obsoleter Excellent use of directives! Not that I am disagreeing with you on your point but what potentially bad patterns would arise with the v-control directive?
It's just that `v-control` does a great job making it easier to reference elements in the DOM from ViewModel methods.  That's a good thing if you want to encourage altering the DOM from the ViewModel, but when you do that it's all view manipulation and does not have to do with updating the model.  The purpose of the ViewModel is to link the view to the model and vice versa.  If the ViewModel has methods that only update the view, then the lines of responsibility between components starts blurring.  

It's the kind of thing that is a short term gain, but long term makes code difficult to debug and extend.  Just my two cents. :)
@obsoleter I really like your insight on the problem and I could see why long term this could have some negative effects. My underlying question for you or Evan would be what would be best practice for manipulating DOM elements? Custom directives? 

For example in one of my projects I am appending some DOM elements via AJAX and handlebars templates. Currently I am doing this straight in the ViewModel method like so:

``` javascript
submit: function() {
    if ($(this.$controls.textarea).val()) {
        var data = JSON.stringify(this.$data);

        app.ajax('post', URL.note.add, data, function(res) {
            var html = template['note-add'](res);
            $(this.$controls.list).prepend(html);
        });
    } else {
        $(this.$controls.textarea).addClass('error');
        return false;
    }
}
```

would it be better to simply reference the Vue model from a variable and grab its data from there? As an example:

``` javascript
var viewmodel = new Vue({...});

$('#foo').on('click', function(e) {
    if ($(this).val()) {
        var data = JSON.stringify(viewmodel.$data);

        app.ajax('post', URL.note.add, data, function(res) {
            var html = template['note-add'](res);
            $('#bar').prepend(html);
        });

        $('#baz').addClass('error');

Custom directives would be my preference.  Vue lets you [register them globally](http://vuejs.org/api/global-methods.html#vue-directive-id-definition-) or add them as an [instantiation option](http://vuejs.org/api/instantiation-options.html#directives) when you create your ViewModel.
@BrandonPierce It seems like the issue is that you have an investment in Handlebars templates and you use jQuery to apply those templates.  If you rewrote your view (meaning, your html templates) using Vue's directives and some custom ones of your own, then it could look something like this:

``` html
<div id=""main"">
  <div v-if=""uploadStatus"" v-with=""uploadStatus"">
    <div v-text=""statusCode""></div>
    <div v-text=""statusMessage""></div>
  </div>
  <textarea v-model=""textData"" v-class=""error: uploadError""></textarea>
  <button v-on=""click: submit"">Submit</button>
</div>
```

``` javascript
var vue = new Vue({
  el: '#main',
  data: {
   uploadError: false,
   uploadStatus: null
  },
  methods: {
    submit: function() {
      if (this.textData) {
        var data = JSON.stringify(this.$data);
        app.ajax('post', URL.note.add, data, function(res) {
          // assuming res has properties statusCode and statusMessage
          this.uploadStatus = res;
          this.uploadError = false;
        });
      } else {
        this.uploadStatus = null;
        this.uploadError = true;
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
});
```

[JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/obsoleter/4u85q/)
@obsoleter is correct. The idiomatic approach in Vue is to write your code in a data-driven fashion. A ViewModel's `$data` not only hold data in the traditional Model sense, but also your View state. You should approach your app logic by thinking about pure states, instead of thinking directly about the DOM. When something needs to change, change the data first, and then define what that change should do to the DOM with directives.

So the best practice is what @obsoleter suggested: your ViewModel methods should try to be mostly about manipulating the state. This provides a separation of concerns and makes your logic easier to reason about and easier to test.
Thanks so much for the advise guys!

If I select two items manually (ctrl + click) shouldn't the debug `p` show those values?
@lfac-pt  That. That is a very good point.
@lfac-pt So I was not adding anything new to the scope on the change event, now this is the case. Demo updated as well.

Seems to be working well now. Very cool!
Thanks for the great work @duckbox ! I cleaned up the code based on your implementation and fixed the casper test case in e16f910948e50968cba914b704fc844a8dc92a8e.

th0r,90,,Support for boolean HTML-attributes,closed,2014-02-09,"Current `v-attr` implementation doesn't support boolean attributes (e.g. `disabled`).
Here is the common use-case:

```
<button type=""submit"" v-attr=""disabled: !submittionAllowed"">
```

It doesn't work because `v-attr` uses `this.el.setAttribute` method. So, when `submittionAllowed` equals to `true`, then submit button will look like this:

```
<button type=""submit"" disabled=""false"">
```

...which is treated by browser as disabled button.
My proposal is to remove current attribute if it's value is falsy (except zero).

duckbox,89,,Editing utils method toText to stringify objects,closed,2014-02-09,"Took lead from this todo https://github.com/yyx990803/vue/issues/83

1. Please work on the source file (`/src/utils.js`) instead of the built files in `/dist/`. Built files are not checked in in the dev branch commits, only in release commits.
2. I feel the whole function should be simplified a little bit, but I do want you to take the credit. I will get back with some more detailed feedback later today.
Sorry, just noticing I did my work in the master of the fork, and not the dev branch. _doh_

I absolutely get what you mean by simplifying a bit. Just following the existing flow. Look forward to your feedback! Cheers.
So all I've done is fixing the syntax and comment a little bit to my personal preference:

``` js
/**
 *  Make sure only strings, booleans, numbers and
 *  objects are output to html. otherwise, ouput empty string.
 */
toText: function (value) {
    /* jshint eqeqeq: false */
    var type = typeof value
    return (type === 'string' ||
        type === 'boolean' ||
        (type === 'number' && value == value)) // deal with NaN
            ? value
            : type === 'object' && value !== null
                ? JSON.stringify(value)
                : ''
},
```

The tests are looking good. If you could make a new PR off from the dev branch, and only check in the changes in `src` files, it should be good to merge.
I'll do that now mate.
